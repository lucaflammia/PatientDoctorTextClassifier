# distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-text-classification

This model is a fine-tuned version of [distilbert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) on an unknown dataset.

# Fine-tuned DistilBERT-base-uncased for Patient-Doctor Classification

# Model Description 

DistilBERT is a transformer model that performs text classification. I fine-tuned the model on with the purpose of classifying patient, doctor or neutral content, specifically when text is related to the supposed context. The model predicts 3 classes, which are Patient, Doctor or Neutral. 

The model is a fine-tuned version of [DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/distilbert).

It was fine-tuned on the prepared dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/LukeGPT88/text-classification-dataset).

It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:
- Loss: 0.0501
- Accuracy: 0.9861

# How to Use 

```python
from transformers import pipeline
classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="LukeGPT88/patient-doctor-text-classifier")
classifier("I see youâ€™ve set aside this special time to humiliate yourself in public.")
```

```python
Output:
[{'label': 'NEUTRAL', 'score': 0.9890775680541992}]
```
