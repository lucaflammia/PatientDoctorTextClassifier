1,"Yeah, for sure, so right now it sounds like a viral picture. It sounds like he has a cold and possibly an ear infection. I'd have to take a look into his ear to be able to tell more uhm because some of his symptoms overlap with those of covid we'll probably do a swab and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours. Uhm and so after I take a look into his ears, we can do one of a couple of things, so if his tympanic membrane looks like it's been perforated, or if there's pus in there, then we'll prescribe him a 10 day course of antibiotics, and if I see like middle ear effusion or his tympanic membranes bulging, and he seems really sick like he has a high fever, what she does, I will again prescribe him 10 days of antibiotics. And if he has a middle ear effusion or a bulging tympanic membrane, just one of those two, and he doesn't seem to be too sick, we can reassess him in 24 to 48 hours. Uhm An antibiotic that we usually prescribe is amoxicillin. Uhh how does that sound?",DOCTOR,1

Uh in the meantime, you should isolate for 14 days, and that includes from family members when possible, and public health will get in touch with you if those results are positive and so they can they can do some contact tracing. If it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around, and I guess the best therapy for that is staying hydrated, um getting good sleep, and eating nutritious foods.

You don't have any other skins, changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called reactive arthritis - where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age and it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment or for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as a X Ray of the of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR. So those are just inflammatory markers as well as the rheumatoid factor antinuclear antibodies. Those are just some things that will test for different kind of rheumatological issues and to see if you have any arthritis.

So, we can do like a AFB smear or I think they have other diagnostic work up for that too. So we'll do that first. If not, we can check to see if it's like another, another typical pneumonia, we can do a chest X Ray for that as well.

It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those.

Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI. Um and so in terms of management of this, um we can try a couple couple of like conservative approaches first, so that includes taking NSAIDs uh for the pain um and then like activity modification. So if you're sitting down um all the time, um perhaps like taking little breaks, uh stretching out your legs, doing some physio as well um during those breaks can help um, and as well, I'm going to give you a referral for physical therapy and they'll do some exercises with you and um slowly increase those exercises. Um and if those still don't work, we can try um steroids, steroid injections, um as well, we talked about the imaging if it doesn't go away in about 6 to 8 weeks. Does that sound OK?",DOCTOR,1

Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?",DOCTOR,1

Also, we will get some sputum smears and cultures to test for TB and we will also, I will need to, if the test comes back positive we will need to contact public health and let your contacts know as well.

Try to rest and, if, if you know taking any medications, over the counter medications is helping you feel better, if you feel like Tylenol, sort of reducing some of that pressure or if doing a, taking a steam bath is sort of helping relieve that pressure, try those.

We're going to do a Covid swab just to rule that out. You should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours, but we will do investigations for lung cancer, so we'll start by doing a chest x-ray just to look for a mass or effusions and then from there if we think there are signs of cancer, we can do a CT. Umm, as well we can like stage with the Pet CT after we take a biopsy and send it off for pathology and that should give us more answers as to if you have cancer and if you do have cancer, what type of cancer so that we can talk about treatment plans and kind of what the prognosis is with those particular types of cancers?

So what we'll do is a COVID swab and that should come back in a day or so, but we do encourage isolation for 14 days and that includes from your girlfriend as well. So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those.

Ddefinitely it can be different types of arthritis that we will investigate just in case as well. But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well.

So definitely, it's very important to get your child vaccinated. In fact, the sum of the symptoms that your child may be having right now can be caused by something called pertussis, and um, there's usually a vaccination for that. Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing. And so, we're going to do some supportive care for her right now, but yeah, definitely, you should consider vaccinating your child. We recommend that to every parent as there's a lot of diseases out there that can be completely prevented if you vaccinate your child.",DOCTOR,1

Try to stay away from your mom as well. And based on the results, you'll get more guidance from public health nurses, and you should just continue to sort of rest and drink lots of water.

And since you have been smoking for a pretty long time, even though you may have quit, which is really great, but that long history of smoking, especially also with um, you working in a mine, those are some things that means we can test as well, and so we may require like a chest x-ray, and even um, a CT scan of your lungs as well. Um, so yeah, first we'll just do a couple tests, do a physical examination, get your vitals, do some blood work and do some of those tests and then we'll also get a COVID swab test done for you as well, just in case.

And what we recommend in the meantime is to self isolate, even in your home, wear a mask around your family, if you can, like, eat separately, don't go outside and be off of work until the test results come back and then even after that, you might need to follow instructions of public health and self isolate for 14 days.

Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.

Where, which can happen in the hip where there's some inflammation and it causes some pain following a viral infection. And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess.",DOCTOR,1

10042,"OK, now we've already talked about other exposures, so it doesn't sound like anyone else in your family or any pets are around, so it's unlikely that you have ticks coming in and you said you might have gotten this from gardening, but um you're hoping that your area doesn't have ticks. Maybe just take a look, ticks like to live in long grass, kind of on the intersection between woods and fields to see if there's any hovering around that kind of make a waving motion with their legs and they're sometimes easy to spot, you might wanna get some insecticide out there. But it sounds like this is fairly recent, unfortunately just for the length of time this tick might be on you for, it's probably safer than not to start you on some medications, but I'm going to go talk to the doctor after we do a quick physical exam, and we might also send the tick off to a local laboratory so they can identify the species for it definitively, as well as might just send some blood work just to see if there's any titres or any serology that would make us a little bit more concerned for Lyme disease.

It's pretty common and um it can be anything from your spinal joints to the discs to the vertebrate or soft tissue or muscle. Um and a lot of these can be caused by um hard activity at work, um like carrying heavy things um and then carrying them in like an improper position or something like that. Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up.

So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned. Depending on what comes back, you might require an admission to the hospital just because we want to make sure you don't go home with an exacerbation, especially with the CHF as well, we need to, we will need to get that under control because that can get worse with your COPD exacerbation as well. So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here.

And from the sounds of it, you said he has a fever. He's coughing and he has a runny nose and has muscle aches. It could also be the flu. Regardless of what kind of viral and viral infection he has, the best way to manage it right now is just supportive care, so making sure he's hydrated, eating foods with a lot of nutrition and just keep an eye on his symptoms. If it gets worse or if it's very severe and he has focal neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, take him to the ER right away. How does that sound?",DOCTOR,1

If it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's been going around during this time of year which is likely because you have COPD, since you're already coughing more than you usually are and seeing more sputum. We will reassess to see whether your puffers are working.

14477,"Uhm, so covid does present in a variety of non specific ways and so it certainly could be on the differential for causing a sore throat and abdominal pain and as well as a fever. However, it could be caused by other things as well. Uhm, currently your constellation of symptoms, with the enlarged lymph nodes in the neck, sore throat, it sounds like you may have uhm, an inflamed spleen as well, which could all be signs and symptoms of something called EBV or, or mono. And it sounds like you might have had an exposure, like your husband or fiance rather may have had this last week with the sore throat. All that being said, today we'll do the monospot test to check for that as well as some blood work. And we will do a covid swab as well, just in case.",DOCTOR,1

14480,"No, OK, uhm, so it sounds like what you may have is something called arthritis, which basically happens, uhm, when the cushions at the ends of your bones and your joints kind of degenerate over the years, and so bone can eventually rub on bone, which causes like the grading sensation and causes the pain. Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. Uhm, and another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint. And if these things don't work in the future, we can also discuss things like steroid injections or joint replacement. Does that sound like a good plan?",DOCTOR,1

Um, and, and then after we reduce it back into its place, um, she should have normal function of her arm again.

Um, and so basically for this, um, we suggest a few things. We'll start with like some conservative management, like activity modification. So at work, if you're doing repetitive movements, maybe not do them so much and take frequent breaks, you can try some like ibuprofen, we'll refer you to some um, physiotherapy to help build those muscles around that, that area. And if those still do, don't work, um, we can try some um, other things like operative um, operative management, but we'll, we'll come back to that in about 6 to 12 months, um, once we uh, we try all of the other stuff.

Taking the most likely thing is that this is a gout flare, and in particular in the toe like that it could be called podagra and so we will need to get a aspiration of the joint fluid just to send it off and make sure that it's not not an infection and that we're treating the right thing. If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories. I will start with medication called colchicine to help with this flare, and in the meantime, important things for preventing this in the future are diet and kind of lifestyle related with reducing things like red meats, alcohol, weight loss and um just trying to improve the diabetes management as well.",DOCTOR,1

15283,"OK, OK, yeah, that's good to know. Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?",DOCTOR,1

15763,"OK, alright yeah, given your young age and the fact that you do a lot of running and a lot of physical activity like cycling and lifting weights, what you have is most likely something called a Patellofemoral syndrome and that is basically a nerve. Uh kind of pain and then in the in the soft tissues and bone around your kneecap. Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good. So, in the meantime, while you while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method and so that stands for resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance. But of those non surgical treatments work we'll also refer you to like am arthroscopy or some sort of surgery that may be able to fix the issue more permanently. Does that sound OK?",DOCTOR,1

Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms.

So will definitely get a swab for COVID testing done for you today which should come back within 24 to 48 hours and in the meantime you should self isolate. And other than that, it can also be, due to this swelling in your lymph nodes and also just the other symptoms, it can be other viral infections. It can be mono so we definitely have to do a couple of tests, and there's one test that will do for mono as well which is called EBV antibody testing. So we'll do a couple of these tests today and then see what what comes back. And in the meantime you should definitely self isolate if you haven't been doing so already.",DOCTOR,1

Alright, so those are all the questions I had for her today, so definitely since there is a risk that she might be having another ear infection, we will need to do like a full physical examination. I'll have to look into her ear to see if I see any inflammation or perforation and then based on that we'll discuss some management. She may require some antibiotics like she has had before, but that will depend on what. I see on physical examination she has been having a fever so she might. And it's only been three days, right? So we may even do some conservative management and get her to take some maybe pain medications and then go from there. Or ear drops.",DOCTOR,1

Things that I'm thinking about right now would be possibly a muscle strain, so this could be a gastrocnemius strain to the calf muscle itself, from from the fall which could have pain when you touch it, there could be some swelling and said it would be aggravated by movements. Also could be like injuries to some of that, the ligaments there as well. And however, with this the swelling immobilization for the last two days, as well as the pain kind of being a bit progressive that with swelling and a positive Homan in test and your temperature is a little bit elevated today not quite a fever, but feverish. It does increase the suspicion for deep vein thrombosis and so I think the most likely thing right now is actually a DVT or deep vein thrombosis. And so we will order some diagnostic studies, get an ultrasound of your right calf as well as an X Ray of the right knee to to start OK.",DOCTOR,1

And so from there we'll see if we need to put you on any antibiotics which will help you. And if we need to get any blood work or X Rays we'll let you know as well. Is that OK?

So with having headache what sounds like you might have a fever and and this cough that sounds like it's pretty bad if you're bringing up some blood, it sounds like you might have irritated some of the bronchioles with the the coughing. So we will test for that and check a PCR nasal swab for COVID. I'm not, but we will also test for other viral illnesses and bacterial illnesses as well. It doesn't sound like you have meningitis right now just based on the symptoms where you don't have neck stiffness, but it'll be certainly something that we keep keep in mind while we are doing our investigations.",DOCTOR,1

18175,"Yeah for sure. So you know, right now we're thinking it could be a viral GI viral infection because of your complaints of nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and fever. But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics. So that's where we will start. How does that sound?",DOCTOR,1

We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there.

19907,"OK, so that is a positive Ober test. Um OK, so what it sounds like is you, it sounds like you have something called um iliotibial um band syndrome, so ITB syndrome, and basically that happens in um athletes, so depending on your like position, like how much you're using those joints um and like repetitive actions um of like knee flexion extension um kind of triggers that. And to treat it, uh we can try some conservative um things first, so the first thing would be um for you um to have some sort of activity modification to prevent aggravating that joint even more, so you're doing a lot of running, so maybe uh switching to things like swimming um for the time being can help with that. And then other things include ice or heating pads, uh taping and stretching, um and then if the pain is, if the pain uh persists, you can try some like ibuprofen for temporary relief. Um we can talk about other treatments as well, like physiotherapy because um it'll be important to kind of strengthen those muscles around that joint as well as um increase your range of motion, so we can do, we can put in a referral for that. Um and if none of those work, we can also discuss um some other things like ultrasound therapy or like muscle stimulation, um shockwave therapy, and then eventually if none of those other things work, we can discuss surgical management but uh it's rare that it ever gets to that point.

20980,"OK, well, from the sounds of it, he most likely has some sort of viral infection. We will do a COVID swap to rule that out because some symptoms do seem to overlap with COVID and we want to make sure to rule that out. So we'll take a swab. Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, he should isolate for 14 days at home and if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection like parainfluenza, also known as croup. So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways. And if it's really, really bad he might be hospitalised as well. So just keep an eye on on that for now. And if you have any",DOCTOR,1

I'm sure you've had X Rays before, so we'll kind of compare them to your shoulder X Rays from before. We, if we need to, we can also get an ultrasound if um we don't, uh we can't really tell from the X Rays. And then from there, um we can get some blood work as well. Um just your normal blood work as well as inflammation markers, and then um from there we'll need to uh, really um discuss some management strategies. So you've already tried some physiotherapy, but now we need to make sure that's uh, it's it's consistent because this is something that has a high recurrence rate and we will definitely need to finish the full course of physiotherapy, whatever it may be, um because if physiotherapy doesn't work, we may have to consider like other options like um corticosteroid injections right into your shoulder.",DOCTOR,1

But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now.

But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.",DOCTOR,1

Um and if it's not covid, it's probably another viral illness that's going around at this time of year.
