It doesn't seem like you have any systemic symptoms of infection, so I'm not too worried about that. And then in terms of your heart, you mentioned you had that chest pain once, but it really does sound more like a lung problem to me than a heart problem to me right now, but of course we'll do all the necessary investigations to rule out any heart stuff. But right now, I'm thinking it could be something called COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder because of your smoking history. Uhm, so we'll start with doing a pulmonary function test and chest x-ray, and I we'll try to go from there. If it is COPD we'll likely put you on a, like a puffer for that. A like a lot a short or long acting beta agonist, that's what it's called. So if your symptoms don't get better with that, we'll do other investigations to try to figure out what this is.

So, I'll definitely have a look inside your throat as well, and if necessary we could do a rapid strep test.

So this may be from the injury that you had with the car accident. And it may be due to some compression of what we call like compression of the nerves in the area which might be giving you some of these symptoms. So the first thing we do need to do is get an MRI of your lower back just to make sure there's nothing going on like for example, like any masses in the area or any kind of abscesses that might be. We may be worried about just to make sure. Well, just to see what's going on in there that's causing these symptoms. And then based on what we find, uh, we will, we will target like the cause of the symptoms, like for example if it's an infect infection that's causing this, you might need to be admitted and require antibiotics. If there is any masses causing it, you may require surgery.

So that could um involve, like uh  you know them doing like and intramedullary nail, plates and screws, and um like some sort of fixation. Um but after the surgery, your fracture will probably take about four to six months to heal completely, uh so in that period um we can talk about like pain management and physiotherapy as well, just to keep the muscles in that area strong and to increase your range of motion.

However, we'll also need to do a joint aspiration of your of your um, go your knee, and we'll be taking some fluid within your joint called the synovial fluid and assess for um, we'll send in for um, culture, and look for like these crystals, and count. And then based on that, we'll understand um, the infection you have and what kind of infection you have.

So we will prescribe some antibiotics for you. Probably amoxicillin. Take those for five to seven days and see if some of your symptoms clear up.

And what you're describing with the flexion seems more pain coming from the discs themselves instead of the facets at the back. So every time you flex you have some compression of your discs. So what we what we need to do right now is it's been one month almost and then usually we get imaging if the pain does not improve after six weeks of conservative management. So what we can try is to give you some pain management first, and some anti-inflammatory medication, and then as well as try some physiotherapy, some exercises to help you with the back pain. And then if the pain does not improve and since there is no red flags that were too worried about right now with your back pain we can wait to get some imaging.
