It was created in 1915 by Ngiam Tong Boon, a bartender at the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. The original recipe has evolved over the years, but it typically includes gin, cherry brandy, Cointreau, Benedictine, grenadine, lime juice, pineapple juice, and a dash of bitters, all garnished with a cherry and a slice of pineapple. The resulting drink is vibrant, fruity, and slightly sweet, making it a perfect choice for tropical climates.⁣⁣Here is our take on the classic cocktail. A sour ale brewed with sweet and tart cherry, pineapple puree and cocktail bitters.

41921,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

42163,"Honestly, some of your symptoms do seem to be overlapping with that of COVID, especially the cough and fever. So we are going to do a COVID swab just to rule that out. So you will get those results in 24 to 48 hours and you should isolate for 14 days because your symptoms overlap. Public health will be in touch with you if it's positive just to do some contact tracing. But if it's not COVID, it could be another viral infection that's going around at this time of year so keep an eye on your symptoms. If they become worse, or if you're experiencing symptoms like neurological deficits or weakness or seizures or anything like that, get help from the ER right away and if your symptoms are persisting beyond like seven days to 10 days, also you should give us a call back to see what's going on because it could be something like a bacterial infection, in which case we can give you some antibiotics.

In a frank and funny chat with Metro, EastEnders icon Natalie Cassidy, 41, talks about the family and friends who make sure her feet are firmly on the ground, overcoming loss and what the chances are of her appearing on I'm A Celeb…Have you always been able to keep your feet on the ground? You grew up from such a young age in the public eye... Yeah, I have. I would put it down to a very normal working-class upbringing. You know, my dad was a newsagent, and my mum was a housewife. I had a lovely childhood. I've got two older brothers and a family around me that keep me grounded. Siblings, nieces, nephews - they all do it. And daughters now [Eliza, 13, and Joanie, seven] who like to tell me, 'It's really boring what you do, Mummy' [laughs].What is the most meaningful life lesson you've learned over the years?One of my favourite sayings is: what other people think of you is none of your business. You need to keep in your lane, do what you think is right, and don't be jealous of other www.people.Be grateful for who you are, and what you've got. If you can get up in the morning and be kind to people and stay true to yourself, that's all you can do. That's what I try to do.And what about the biggest challenge you have had to overcome?The biggest thing for me is the loss of my parents. I lost my mum [Evelyn, following a battle with cancer] when I was 19, and I lost my dad [Charles] a few years ago. I try to remain - to get through grief and turn that into a positive, and remember great things about them, and to know that you've done your best, that's a big life lesson for me.I'm 38 and currently living at home with my folks, who are in their 70s, and you just start to see mortality slowly but surely creeping in...My dad lived with me. He moved in with me in the last six years of his life. I was very, very close to my dad after losing my mum, and then I had him stay with me. So, I understand fully where you are, but they're young, don't worry about it, don't panic too much. It's a gift. Listen, I did everything for my dad, and I have no regrets. I just miss him, which is very special.You recently celebrated your 41st birthday - belated congratulations. How do you feel about getting older?I don't really think about it. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I'm happy, in terms of how confident I am in myself, and the friends and family I've got around me. I split my time very well now. I can count my best friends on one hand. I know what I want to do, and I say no to things if I want to say no to them. I've probably become a bit more intolerant of things that I don't like as I get older. You become braver as a person the more life you've experienced. I just want to try and carry on doing what I'm doing.How much of a kick do you still get from playing Sonia Fowler in EastEnders? I absolutely adore it. I've been doing it for over 30 years. It's my comfort really. It is somewhere I go and feel at home. I'm honoured to still have the part and that Sonia is growing older, like me. It's just a great place to work.Have any behind-the-scenes moments really stayed with you?I'd say when Prince Charles and Camilla visited us for the [Queen's platinum] jubilee episodes. They were fantastic, and obviously they weren't king and queen at the time. That was a wonderful day, to meet them and have them there. We were all dressed up for the jubilee, and it was snowing for a while. So, that's something to remember, when you're in your nurse's outfit and it's freezing cold!Which EastEnders legend would you like to see return to the show?Oh gosh! To be honest, I would say Pam St Clement, [who played] Pat Butcher. She died in the show [in 2012] but I think if you had Pat turn up with the earrings and knock on the door, it'd light the place up!What other acting ambitions do you have? Is there a dream role in mind? I can see myself in a gritty drama. I've been watching Slow Horses and The Gentlemen, and I watch those and think, I could be an East End gangster, that'd be good. Or even to play someone downstairs in a house in Victorian times, being a cook who's cheeky. I also love comedy… I suppose I've never had the time to explore it, but yeah, I'd love to do some kind of sitcom. That's my dream.You also host podcast OffThe Telly with Joanna Page. What are your TV turn-ons and offs?Turn-ons would be any cooking programme. I know people think that's dull but for me, comfort watching isMasterChef, or a little bit of Jamie Oliver. And turn-offs? I am not one for true crime… or the afternoon-y Homes Under The Hammer. I'm also not a massive fan of medical dramas, but only because when I watch them, I go, 'I don't know how you're learning those lines, all those medical terms.'Last year your name was being bandied about for I'm A Celeb…rity… Get Me Out Of Here! Would you ever be tempted? Sometimes I think, oh, that would be fun. And then a bluebottle will fly into my bedroom and I'm screaming. I think, what are you talking about, you're never going to do it. I always say I'd be the first celeb to die on live TV [laughs]. As much as it's a fantastic show, and never say never, if I needed to do it, I might have to, however I would make a real fool of myself… funny is one thing, desperately, uncontrollably scared is another!Now this is something I'm actively trying to manifest… there is talk of there being a celeb spin-offof The Traitors UK, and I think you'd be great!I would love that. Sign me up. I'd be a Traitor. It's more fun, isn't it? But yeah, I'd be up for it tomorrow, in a heartbeat.How do you like to unwind?With [partner] Marc, and a gin and tonic. Get the kids to bed, and play our records. We've got an eclectic range of music. For my birthday, Marc bought me a rare collection of Oasis B-sides.Do you have any other hobbies?Going into London on my own and wandering around art galleries.What is your most annoying habit?I snore - I sound like Darth Vader when I go to sleep, which isn't great. I do bite my nails, but usually pop on an acrylic to stop that habit. And I say 'umm' a lot.What is your pet peeve?Rudeness and lateness. People being rude for no reason and being late is not acceptable… being short, sharp, no eye contact, not saying hello properly. I know we're all heads down on our phones, but let's bring our heads up and chat to people. Let's have a bit of social contact. I think it's important.Can you share with me an unpopular opinion?For somebody who has been in EastEnders for 30 years… I'm not really a fan of pie and mash!That could be a career-destroying admission![laughs]. I just don't like pies and I'm not a fan of mash, so putting the two together - I'm not saying I wouldn't eat it, but it just doesn't excite me.Have you ever had an awkward showbiz run-in?I was at a soap awards, and I had a corset dress - in my bigger days - and I had it too tight, and I thought I was going to faint. At one point a director of mine, who is still a dear friend, had to undo it for me, and whilst that was happening, Jerry Springer was knocking about, which was quite embarrassing.EastEnders airs Monday to Thursday at 7.30pm on BBC One",NEUTRAL,2

So we'll do a swab and those swabs should come back to you in about 24 to 48 hours and until then, it's important that you do isolate and you isolate for 14 days at least, and that includes from other people at home. And if those swabs come back negative, you could possibly have like, another infection. But if your symptoms worsen, like you start getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures or anything like that, you should come back to the ER and we'll get that checked out. And, so that's where we'll start for now, because your presentation is acute, we think it's likely infection related.",DOCTOR,1

43311,"London-based Brockmans makes a workable gin which it's dubbed ""Intensely Smooth,"" and for its next trick it's turning to our old friend tequila for inspiration. Brockmans Agave Cut is built on a backbone of ""agave spirit"" made in Jalisco, Mexico — which presumably is not tequila because of some aspect of its distillation and/or the fact that it was shipped off to Britain to be turned into something entirely different. Flavorings include pink grapefruit, lime, lemon peel, juniper berries, orange peel, coriander, liquorice, almond, cassia bark, angelica, and orris. The big twist is of course the agave base, but nosing the spirit reveals not a slug of agave but rather another of the above ingredients completely dominating. This the grapefruit show, folks, and it comes across on the nose closer to a glass of Squirt than any gin (or tequila) I've ever encountered. There must be a ton of the stuff here, because it's so powerful it puts everything else out of mind. On the palate, things are a bit more complex, but you can't come remotely close to shaking the impact of the grapefruit. However, the classic fruit flavor is countered by a not insignificant bitterness, the angelica and orris providing a gently earthy underbelly as backdrop. Lime leaf is particularly notable on the finish, as is some orange — heavy on peel. What's nearly absent throughout is juniper, which becomes evident primarily as an afterthought alongside the earth-heavy elements as the finish fades out. At which point you remind yourself that, hey, I think this is actually tequila. 82.4 proof.

43365,"Calafate berries growing in Ushuaia. I ate one of those. We were first introduced to the Calafate berry by one of our guides in Ushuaia. It is a native, thorny shrub that grows a purple-black berry. I tasted one, and it is tart somewhat like a current. Of course, I was immediately captivated — native, edible/tasty berries are right up my alley. A couple nights later, D and I were having dinner, and the gals at the table behind us got a frou-frou drink from the bar... it was pink and frothy looking. They got them in little glasses, like they are all sharing one drink. D says something to our waiter about them and he was a little dismissive, then said, ""you want something local?"" We were like ""Yeah!"" So he brought us what was basically a gin and tonic with local berries mixed in. mmm, good! We'll be playing on this concept this summer! Wild berry gin and tonic. It was then that I started to clue in to Argentine gin. I wasn't prepared for that and didn't pivot quickly enough. We should have had more. It was dry, juniper-y, and quite good. But back to the calafate berry. We saw the Calafate berry (Berberis microphylla) in Ushuaia, and throughout our Patagonia stays. I've since learned they are native to Patagonia, and they are a relative of our native Oregon Grape (Berberis aquifolium). Like the Oregon Grape, the birds are happy with them too. Snacking on the good stuff! One regret on the trip, besides not tasting enough gin, was that I didn't get to taste the Calafate liquor that we started to see toward the end of our stay. Had we spent more time in touristy shops, we likely would have clue-in to it's existence sooner. I had intended to pick some up at the airport on our way out, but our airport departure was rushed and frantic (definitely not my favorite way to travel) and airport shopping just wasn't possible.",NEUTRAL,2

If this is, gout and it comes back that this way it's treated with that high dose, high doses of anti inflammatories.

43846,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

Or a couple of the bitters. Some of the beers are nice to have on a hot summer day and if you find a nice bottle of wine those are good, too, especially paired with the right food.These days I do not drink, though, because I try to avoid excess calories, which any alcohol certainly is. Plus I also suffer from heartburn if I drink too much.I would defo not drink just vodka by itself unless somehow I get into some self-destructive mode and want to get totally sh.tfaced for some reason.

45540,"NEW YORK - In 2022, a bar called Martiny's - pronounced like the drink - opened near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. As one might expect from a place named after the world's most famous cocktail, there is a martini on the menu. It is purple.That signature cocktail - the Grand Martiny's - is made of gin, manzanilla sherry, port wine, elderflower liqueur and Cognac. It's a twist on a 50-50 martini from Takuma Watanabe, the cocktail bar's beverage director and a founder. ""I love martinis,"" he said.He has company. In the past few years, New York and other major cities are awash in martinis, many of them straying far from the traditional template. Speculation within the industry on the source of the drink's ascent varies: There's the nostalgia for a simpler era, the sharpening of drinkers' palates thanks to COVID-era home bartending and, of course, the need for a stiff drink in hard times. The popularity of the espresso martini, too, cannot be discounted, if only for keeping the word martini in constant circulation.Every new bar or restaurant seems to offer a special martini. And just as in the so-called 'tini era of the 1990s - when anything in a conical glass sported the name martini, no matter the ingredients - many don't stop at one.The martinis at Chezchez, an airy aperitivo-style bar in San Francisco, include the Coastal Martini, made of aquavit, sherry and vermouth. At Sweet Liberty in Miami, the martini list is six drinks long, with modern versions of '90s staples like the lychee martini and the lemon drop.Oui Cocktail Lounge, a bar in Flatbush, Brooklyn, also has a lemon drop riff, made with vodka, sherry and lemon cordial. Little Ned, in the old NoMad space in the Flatiron district, has a vodka-based Champagne martini made with Lillet Blanc and a Champagne reduction, and an Everything Martini, a gin-vodka blend flavored with a roasted-allium tincture and garnished with mozzarella balls.It's enough to make you take all the talk of a 1990s revival seriously. Are we living through a new martini era?""I think it's a much more refined 'tini era, if it is,"" said Chris Moore, the beverage director of the Ned NoMad, the hotel and members' club that contains Little Ned.Moore, whose resume includes stints at Coupette in London and Dante in Manhattan, is among the seasoned cocktail bartenders leading this explosion of variegated martinis. He recalls how the craft- cocktail community, which arose in the early 2000s, rejected the syrupy horrors of martinis past. Now, however, he is all in on martini experimentation.""I quite like the idea of taking a classic twist on a martini and twisting it again,"" he said. ""Now I see the reinvention of the apple martini.""Julie Reiner, a leader in the craft-cocktail business for two decades, has tried to improve the appletini more than once. She first attracted attention in 2000 at the Greenwich Village restaurant C3 for her improved version of that '90s bar staple, which used apple-infused vodka, apple liqueur and sparkling cider. At her SoHo bar Milady's, she serves apple martinis that are even better. One version contains apple- infused gin and vodka, as well as apple brandy and apple liqueur.She thinks the martini's resurgence is driven in large part by nostalgia. ""And there's something to be said for those flavors,"" she said. ""A lot of people want to drink martinis, but a classic martini is too strong for them.""The critical differences between yesterday's and today's creative martinis are skill and ingredients. While the old martinis were mostly made of vodka and cloying liqueurs, today's bartenders insist on higher-quality spirits and a drier touch.""It's not just any random ingredient served in a martini glass,"" said Sam Ross, an owner of Attaboy, who helped reopen Temple Bar in NoHo, which offers nearly a dozen martinis. ""This time around, it's based around clear spirits stirred with wine-based products,"" he said, in the same way that the classic martini mixes clear gin or vodka with vermouth.Ross pointed out that 20 years ago, bartenders didn't have access to the wide variety of vermouths, sherries and other wine-based spirits imported today. This allows for a wider array of martinis that are nonetheless closer to the classic model than to the sweet potions of the 1990s.The martini-thirsty public has also played a part in creating this expanding martini universe. Ashley Santoro, the beverage director of Deux Chats in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knew her customers were going to order standard martinis anyway. There was no point in listing a classic version on the menu. The two martinis available are the Deux Chats Martini, made with gin, vermouth, sherry and celery brine; and the Kinky Martini, made with Thai-chile- infused vodka, a chile liqueur and two aperitifs.If the cocktail revival of the past two decades has been a history of bartenders trying to correct bad practices and misunderstood cocktails, perhaps the new martinis are the ultimate correction, taking a chapter of cocktail history that had been written off as a train wreck and rewriting it as a creative embroidering on a classic.Naren Young, the creative director of Sweet Liberty, sees value in making a great version of something that is often made poorly. ""Maybe I can drink a good apple martini,"" Young said. ""Maybe I can have a great lemon drop. There's nothing wrong with it if it's done well.""",NEUTRAL,2

While some may find baijiu challenging, its broad profile and unique distillation method yield diverse taste experiences, ranging from gin-like notes to funky rum flavors. Trust me, this is not what you think.We've taken on the challenge of creating a drink that celebrates rather than masks baijiu's robust flavors. With the rise of baijius tailored to international palates, we've selected Joyouth Jiang Xiao Bai, a 40% Light Aroma Baijiu that offers an approachable yet authentic taste.The Dragon's Lagoon is a baijiu-based drink that draws inspiration from the legendary koi fish, known for their perseverance and transformation. Koi fish origins date back to 4th century China and symbolize many concepts including harmony and unity. Peach boba pearls playfully represent the koi swimming in a refreshing pond, surrounded by cucumber lily pads and reeds of fennel micro greens. Clarified lemon juice and aloe juice provide balance, while lemongrass ginger syrup introduces an herbal sweetness. This cocktail enhances the robust flavor of baijiu while offering a refreshing twist that anyone can enjoy. Dive into the pond and savor this symbol of good fortune and vitality!

You don't have any other skins, changes or any other symptoms. It can also be since you have had a you were sick for months ago with a what might be gastroenteritis. It can be sometimes a few months afterwards you can get something called reactive arthritis - where you get this progressive pain in your joints and stiffness. And otherwise it can also be something called ankylosing spondylitis, which can present in men your age and it's kind of like a progressive, dull back pain and that has some morning stiffness as well. So yeah, there's definitely multiple things that it can be. So first we would need to do a full physical examination and book an appointment or for that in person. And we will get some lab work done as well, as well as a X Ray of the of the spine and your sacroiliac joints. And we'll also get some blood work with CBC, CRP and ESR.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

47087,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

Those PCR results should come back in about 24 to 48 hours.

So for that, for any of these viral infections, actually the best treatment is to stay at home and make sure that he's very well hydrated and eating well. If his symptoms persist for three to five days or more, or if his symptoms worsen, especially if he has like a seizure or urological issues, he should go to the ER and if his symptoms do become worse, we can also prescribe him some steroids or epinephrine just to open up his airways.

So even if the COVID swab comes back negative, sometimes it can be false negative, so as long as you're having these symptoms, and these symptoms are common in COVID,  we do ask that you isolate for 14 days if the swab comes back positive. We will also notify public health so that they can get in touch with you and do some contact tracing to see where you may have gotten COVID from, but other than that, if it's not COVID, it could likely be another upper respiratory viral illness because of this time of year. A lot of different viruses are going around like common viruses or the flu, you know, so it could be one of those.

The point is to self insert. Such passive MCs are perfect vessels for that. The more personality the MC has, the more likely it will clash with the reader, making it less easy to self insert. Which is why hetrare MCs are a good thing for moege.&gt;Thankfully ""Tsuki no Kanata de Aimashou"" is much better, hopefully it will get a good translation for people one day.Tsukikana is a good charage, some routes even excellent nakige (Uguisu's rout is heart wrenching). But it's a terrible moege. Seira's route was pretty bad and literally all the ~~hag~~ pardon me, adult heroine routes were terrible.

48138,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

48550,"I have a lot of thoughts about this so bear with me here. First and foremost, you're not too old for a birthday party, EVER. Second of all, this should be all about you and your likes, and your happiness. Any reasonable adult can manage mingling and making new acquaintances at a party on their own. You shouldn't be worried about that. If someone chooses to sit in the corner, that is their problem, not yours! Also, some people might be more comfortable that way. That doesn't mean you did something wrong. It's not your job as the birthday girl to micromanage everyone else's social mobility. I would suggest telling your closest/best friend(s) that you want to throw yourself a birthday party and ask if they would be interested in helping you. When I say closest I mean like 1 or 2 people. That way, there is someone who can help you set up and be the person to bring out cake, and be like a secondary hostess in addition to yourself. Let's go through your questions. How long should the party be, when do people sing, when to do cake: are a majority of your friends parents, or people who like to turn in early? if so, a nice dinner party that is from around 5pm to 9ish or so might be nice. if you have a little bit more of a party crowd, go for a 7pm-whenever party. you don't really need to specify an end time unless you're concerned about people overstaying their welcome.   How do I get more comfortable with bringing people together who don't know each other?: again, it is part of being invited to a party that you have to mingle with your friends' friends. you should not have to worry about this. try not to take on the responsibility yourself. What activities can I do: what would you enjoy? what is fun for you? you could have a more upscale dinner party with a few bottles of good wine and some fancy cheeses and fruits and bring out a game that encourages people to have conversation with one another. better yet, a game where people have to get on teams to play. if you and your friends are a silly/rowdy bunch you could serve beers and seltzers and find a karaoke machine. you could also put on a good movie on the tv, play some nice music from a stereo, and have things like dice and playing cards around so that people can naturally fall into their own activities. I think your notion that people just sitting around talking doesn't make a good party is false. it's totally okay not to provide everyone with special activities. you're adults! they should be there to enjoy your company and have a nice time. Do you decorate for a party you're throwing for yourself?: This is where a close friend comes in. Enlist some help from someone who cares about you. for a dinner party you could put down a nice table cloth and buy some fresh flowers and light a few candles. for anything else you could throw up a banner that says ""happy birthday"" and just make sure your house is clean. believe it or not, a party playlist sets the ambience more than decorations ever will.   How much food do I need?: You definitely need cake if you like cake, that part is for you! Other than that, you can have anything from a full dinner to ""party snacks"" to just some pretzels, nuts, and candy. Just be transparent about what food will be there so people can plan accordingly. I recently went to an adult birthday that served popcorn, jelly beans, and tequila. If you don't want to make cocktails, provide wine and beer. Alternatively, pick two hard liquors and a couple of mixers. i.e. whiskey and cokes/gin and tonic. vodka and juice/tequila and marg mix. people can make their own drinks :) dont forget ice! What invitation method are people using nowadays?: text message or good old fashioned paper invites. although I would say a paper invite does kind of imply a more ""serious"" party like a dinner party. Do I need a theme? Do you think a themed party is easier or harder to execute?: You don't need a theme. The point of a theme is to just add fun to the party. It's harder if you're going to stress over it. It's fun if you think it would be fun to dress up as \_\_\_\_, and you're excited to do so. Do I bail on the idea of a home party and just invite people to a restaurant instead: I think home parties are lovely and much better than gathering people who aren't all acquainted at a restaraunt.   Overall, remember that this is your birthday and your main focus should be celebrating yourself and fulfilling your own desires. It's everyone else's responsibility to gather around and celebrate you, and refrain from stressing you out or making your life more difficult! I hope you are able to have a party that you enjoy and don't forget to take photos for years to come.",NEUTRAL,2

49215,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings. I hope you give them a try! Enjoy your gardens.

49679,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas – 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

49805,"Hello again! I have just received a few more samples of some scents from the house of Zoologist. This time, I've got Squid, Moth, and T-Rex, as well as a few other surprises I figured I'd write about.Firstly, my review of Perfumology. They're located in Philly, and have some decently priced samples available. The samples are 2ml, in a small plastic spray bottle. While the quality of the sprayers is not quite as good as Ministry of Scent (those came in lovely little glass sprayers), I would bargain a guess that there is actually more than 2ml in here, and the sprayer itself is much easier to use. Shipping was much faster. I believe my samples shipped within a day, though USPS took their sweet time to no fault of Perfumology. They rerouted it to Salt Lake City, when I live a state away from Perfumology. But I digress. Onto the reviews!**Squid - 8.5/10**There's a reason this is a favorite. It's salty, inky, and incense-y, all in wonderful ways. I really am transported to the beach, at night. It's very mineralic and watery in a fantastic way, and there is a subtle sweetness to it. I have just had oysters for the first time the other night and I am reminded of that experience. I expected a fishy-ness to this scent, as I expected fishy-ness to the oysters. Instead, I've gotten kissed by ocean water-- Difference being that I like it here, whereas oysters didn't do much for me. Its the perfect scent to wear on a warm night by the ocean, and I will be doing just that. The incense is in the background but adds a nice bit of complexity.    My roommate smelled this, and described it as ""Fruity"". Take this with a hefty dose of salt. I sprayed this on my wrist and my one friend smelled the air a few times later that evening, but made no mention of it. That counts as a winner in my book.**Moth - 7/10**So much spice here, backed up by oodles of flowers and whisps of smoke. I imagine the Grand Archives in Dark Souls 3 smells like this. It's incense-y, but in a much darker way than Camel was. Once it dries, the spice cabinet goes away and makes room for the smoke and wood. Past that, the flowers all fade away too, leaving only the dark notes behind. Some powdery notes bring it back from the brink. Interesting that at first, I really didn't like this, and after a second sample I really do like it. I will save it for the winter, when I am feeling especially broody.**T-Rex - 5.5/10**I am running a barbecue. My dad walks past me, wearing his special ""Night out"" cologne. There is a plane crash in the distance. Is it challenging? Yes. Finally. But I let my roommate smell this (he has genuinely 0 experience with cologne) and he thought it was OK. He agreed, it smells like a barbecue. But I do like this, and I will wear this for special occasions, Maybe people will be put off by it, but they will notice it. There is something to be said about that.     Objectively, there is lots and lots of herbs and spices in here, and maybe something like a woodworking shop heavy with oils and waxes and burning tools. There's a rubbery feel to it, and something about it makes me nostalgic for the smell of two-stroke dirtbike engines. The main ""vibe"" I get here is that old propane barbecue, I really can't put my finger on it. It *evokes* that feeling, but doesn't necessarily *smell* exactly like an old barbecue. Still new to this, I guess that's what a note is in fragrances.    It's still a fragrance. It's still wearable. I couldn't see most people making it work, and I don't know if I can make it work. But god damn it I'll try. In terms of interesting-ness, this is a 10/10. It edges out in ""woah"" vs. The Smell of Weather Turning (My love, I'll get you one day), but paling in wearability. My sample, resting beneath the test strips of 4 other scents, handily beats them all out and is the only thing I smell from that direction. It is powerful, so be warned.**Bonus section: freebies from Perfumology!****Boutique - 4/10**Straight up Febreeze. Genuinely smells exactly like Febreeze Air. Taking a look at the notes, I do get the Red Apple and I guess the woods? Seriously though, Febreeze. I will give this another try some day but for now it will be a room scent. Pro tip: Spray a laundry sheet with whatever fragrance you like, and put it in front of your air conditioner's filter. It will fill the room in no time and lasts pretty long. Northern Cardinal and Boutique will make my room smell so clean!**Grange - 8/10**Pretty shocked that this sample blew me away so much! Foresty in a gorgeous way, and something about this gives me gin &amp; tonic to the max. Must be the lime and the woods combining in just the right way. The tobacco, not so much. It's probably in there but I cant discern it so well. It comes off, overall, outdoorsy in a nice way.  I also thought I got some sort of burnt clutch, oil smell here, but on second thought some T-Rex must have made its way to my fingers.**Finally, some updates on previous reviews:**Sloth still reigns supreme in my eyes (bumping to a 9/10), but only really makes a debut on rainy days in practice, or when I'm sitting at home. The longevity is amazing, I sprayed it on myself in the morning, then did my whole day and went to bed, and in the morning I still smelled it upon waking up. Tremendous! My girlfriend likes this one.Dodo Jackfruit might be my overall favorite in terms of wearability. It just smells so pleasant and makes me feel confident in how I smell. Longevity is also pretty good, but after a while it really just dries into baby powder which is my main gripe with it. If anyone has any fugere (?) recommendations that aren't quite as pricy, please do let me know. I would wear this as a daily scent and maybe I'll spring for a bottle if I find myself with some extra cash.Koala comes up close behind, I have worn it for maybe 3-4 days now and it's a very palatable scent. Projection isn't great, but it's so nicely wearable and family has complimented me on it. Camel is in dead last. I'm not sure what happened but I lost that red wine, dried fruit, bazzar feeling and really just get incense. It smells like walking around by the incense sticks at East Meets West, and frankly I don't know when I'll wear this. I am interested in the concept, and I think perhaps Sacred Scarab is more what I was expecting.   **Final Thoughts**I am happy to be challenged here. Zoologist has made me love fragrances and I now wander around the cheapo scents at Target (or whatever department store) and try them all, only to be disappointed that none are so complex or inspiring. T-Rex is off putting in a gorgeous way and was really what I expected from everything from Zoologist. The only downside is that now I would like to buy a sample of everything from Zoologist. Maybe for my birthday, I'll do just that.",NEUTRAL,2

50001,"Hm. That's a tricky one. At one point fans really REALLY wanted more Sakamoto, but Sorachi said the time for him to receive his own arc had already passed. He stated his absence was part of his characteristics, which I think makes sense. But same time I believe we should have gotten more; even if it's another small appearance before entering the final arcs.What makes this question tricky is I think Sorachi was looking to make his character scarce from the start. What people tend to miss is the characters are models after historical people but the main roster of characters aren't as straight forward as Hijikata, Kondo, Sogo, and Katsura.Gintoki is said to be based on Sakata Kintoki, a Japanese folklore. But Sorachi stated he only took the physical strength and reworked the name to use for the main protagonist. He never aimed to create the legendary wild boy.If you look at Gintoki's life in Edo, and Ryoma Sakamoto's life, you can see Sorachi was recreating his story through mostly Gintoki. He's a split between Gintoki and Sakamoto's characters. As a kid Sakamoto was a wimp, to put it simply. His eldest sister, Otome was possibly his biggest influence in his life. She was a strong capable woman who was worried about her younger brother so she pushed him to do something that he could take to. He was bullied a lot in school so she enrolled him in a fencing school and he took to that quite well. Before this he wasn't the best scholar. He loved his sister for being so rough with him because it got him out of his shell. A number of people think she and Ryoma may be models for Otae and Shinpachi.Gintoki, a skilled samurai, much like Ryoma became. He was so skilled by the time he was an adult that he became an instructor for one of the top three fencing schools of Edo. It's during this time that we know he fought and lost against Katsura Kogoro, another chief instructor at one of the schools.Moving on: Gintoki lives much of Sakamoto's early adulthood:-Went to Edo to make a name for himself -Ryoma meets a lady Tereyada (Otose)- meets his future wife, Oryo, who's father died early and left his family destitute. With no adult male figure, her family were an easy target for predators.The family sold their home and began to sell their belongings. Oryo then began selling her clothes so that her mother and younger sisters wouldn't have to. Eventually, the kids were scattered. I think her youngest brother was five and her entered the Shibataguchi as an acolyte. Meanwhile one of Oryo's younger sisters was duped and taken by a scoundrel and sold to the Shimabara as a maiko.When Oryo realized this she sold her last good kimono and headed for Osaka to confront the villains there. She didn't care if they killed her, and she carried a dagger. When they saw how determined she was, the scoundrel showed her the tattoo on his arm and shouted threats at her. But she had come prepared to die, and so she flew at him, grabbing his clothing, striking him in the face, and exclaimed that if he didn't return the younger sister he had brought to Osaka with him she would stab him.The wretch shouted, ""Look out, woman, or I'll kill you!"" They went at each other with shouts of ""Kill!"" and ""Do you worst!""After all, through, he couldn't very well murder the woman who had come to Osaka, and so she was able to get her younger sister back and take her to Kyoto with her again. Isn't that a story? The youngest daughter in the Shimabara is in no danger immediately, so she has left her there for now.It was this story that won Ryoma's love and admiration. He explains in letters to his sister that he's helping to get her siblings places, and he's entrusted Oryo to the care of the landlady of the Teredaya as he was already planning to marry Oryo, simply because he was in love with this strong awesome woman.These events are written by Ryoma to his eldest sister. These remind me of episodes three where Otae sacrifices herself for her families dojo. And episode 36 where Otae's young coworker got duped by a con artist. Sakamoto already thought they were meant to be when he first met her because they both had RYO in their names. Gintama's Sakamoto and Oryo play off on that last aspect I think. But overall I can see the famous couple within Tae and Gin's dynamic. They don't come together at the end but honestly Sorachi gave highlights to their dynamic. Otose is pretty much the famous lady. However (this may be just me) but since the young don't get together in the Gintama series. I think he used Otose to showcase the later facet of Oryou's life, after Ryōma's death. She grew old and faded to obscurity. Many of Ryōma's friends never went to check on her except Saigo, whose Gintama counterpart was close to Otose and became a close companion to Otae.Ryoma later in life, created a shipping company fleet which is what Sakamoto mostly lived in the series. It's probably why we never see him as Gintoki is already living most of the originals life. Not having Sakamoto around much made sense. But Idk why Sorachi even made Sakamoto in the first place if the only reason he exists is to have jokes about how irrelevant he is. He's a great businessman and negotiator. He had a significant role towards the end.Though Sakamoto's screen time in Gintama is extremely limited the way Sorachi was able to maximize that time especially in the later arcs displays how phenomenal of a character he is.He plays the fool but he's honestly one of the smartest characters in Gintama with a business. But because he plays a crucial role as negotiator and somewhat in charge of Nobu Nobu, I would have liked a bit more showing from Sakamoto  because of that role being pivotal. Him being silly and absent, then popping up and being a boss, seems like it was Sorachi giving such an absurd character time to shine before the series end. I'd say it was handled fairly well but more time with him wouldn't have hurt. I just expected more than what we got. Not just from him but all of the Joui 4 members.",NEUTRAL,2

Hahaha. Mmmm. Warm weather and shorts. I'm so jealous. Does the family know yet? Or still a secret. Yesterday did not go well. As much as I'm bummed to not be pregnant, it wouldn't be good if I was. So I had the MRI for my broken foot, figured I'd be going back to work 1/2 days as there is still pain….nope. The head of my metatarsal where the fractures were is lighting up like a Christmas tree. They've labeled it ""bone marrow edema,"" and it's spreading up the bones and getting worse. My Dr straight up told me he's confused and never seen anything like this. He's referring me to an orthopedic surgeon in Idaho that specializes in foot/ankle injuries. (My Dr is an ortho but he specializes in hand/wrist).He also ordered blood work done to check for bone marrow infection (I mean…infection in general…he'd need to biopsy the bone to know if that's what we're seeing.) you guessed it, my rbc and wbc a both super elevated. Which is funny because when he ordered it he figured it would be negative since I have no fever, my toes are cold to the touch, no chills…nothing to indicate an infection. Plus there were no open wounds to my foot. I have no other infections. It's bizarre. I guess 2-5 people in 100k can develop an infection with no wounds. so now I'm scared and stressed. and the specialist cant fit me in for two weeks so i need to talk to my dr to see if he wants me to wait that long or scrap it and come back to him for biopsies/potentially surgery. So there's that. And it's supposed to snow tomorrow. Ugh. 🤦🏼‍♀️",NEUTRAL,2

50810,"San Miguel Beer is poised to put Rain or Shine in a choke hold before its youthful but tenacious opponents find an opening to strike back.The top-seeded Beermen warded off the Elasto Painters' challenge at the start of the PBA Philippine Cup semifinal series, 101-98, then repeated with a dominant 106-89 rout to seize control in the best-of-seven contest.As they shoot for a commanding 3-0 lead in a road entanglement at the Dasmariñas Arena in Cavite today, SMB coach Jorge Gallent reminded his powerhouse charges to stay the course.'As of now, two wins are nothing. We have to get four so there's nothing to celebrate about,' said Gallent, reiterating the one-step-at-a-time approach of their grand plans to retain the league's crown jewel.'This is our third step. First was the eliminations, second was the quarterfinals. We're on our third and this isn't over yet. We need four (wins) to finish this step.'The Beermen, with PBA Press Corps-Pilipinas Live Player of the Week June Mar Fajardo as anchor, seek No. 3 in the 4:30 p.m. curtain-raiser after which Meralco and Ginebra break their 1-1 standoff at 7:30 p.m.The Gin Kings and the Bolts continue what's tipped to be a slugfest between old playoff rivals out to settle the score.'We have so much respect for them and I'm sure they have the same respect for us. It's gut it out, it's hard (fought). I'm sure the fans enjoy that, we enjoy it, we love that type of atmosphere,' said Meralco mentor Luigi Trillo.The Gin Kings drew first blood, 92-88, but the Bolts quickly countered, 103-91.'It's just one game (won). We just made it a (virtual) best-of-five. We know they're going to come back so we've got to be ready,' said Trillo.The Bolts spoiled the 41-point explosion of Ginebra workhorse Christian Standhardinger in Game 2. This one-man-army concept is a major talking point for coach Tim Cone after the loss.'The game plan was obvious, put the ball on Christian's hands and make them beat us from the line. And he was almost up to the task. He kept his goings, he kept his hands. But they (Meralco) did a good job of shutting everybody else down.' said Cone.'We need to get contributions from everybody and we didn't get that (in Game 2),' he added.",NEUTRAL,2

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""
