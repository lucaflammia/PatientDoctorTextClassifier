Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

590,"NEW YORK - In 2022, a bar called Martiny's - pronounced like the drink - opened near Gramercy Park in Manhattan. As one might expect from a place named after the world's most famous cocktail, there is a martini on the menu. It is purple.That signature cocktail - the Grand Martiny's - is made of gin, manzanilla sherry, port wine, elderflower liqueur and Cognac. It's a twist on a 50-50 martini from Takuma Watanabe, the cocktail bar's beverage director and a founder. ""I love martinis,"" he said.He has company. In the past few years, New York and other major cities are awash in martinis, many of them straying far from the traditional template. Speculation within the industry on the source of the drink's ascent varies: There's the nostalgia for a simpler era, the sharpening of drinkers' palates thanks to COVID-era home bartending and, of course, the need for a stiff drink in hard times. The popularity of the espresso martini, too, cannot be discounted, if only for keeping the word martini in constant circulation.Every new bar or restaurant seems to offer a special martini. And just as in the so-called 'tini era of the 1990s - when anything in a conical glass sported the name martini, no matter the ingredients - many don't stop at one.The martinis at Chezchez, an airy aperitivo-style bar in San Francisco, include the Coastal Martini, made of aquavit, sherry and vermouth. At Sweet Liberty in Miami, the martini list is six drinks long, with modern versions of '90s staples like the lychee martini and the lemon drop.Oui Cocktail Lounge, a bar in Flatbush, Brooklyn, also has a lemon drop riff, made with vodka, sherry and lemon cordial. Little Ned, in the old NoMad space in the Flatiron district, has a vodka-based Champagne martini made with Lillet Blanc and a Champagne reduction, and an Everything Martini, a gin-vodka blend flavored with a roasted-allium tincture and garnished with mozzarella balls.It's enough to make you take all the talk of a 1990s revival seriously. Are we living through a new martini era?""I think it's a much more refined 'tini era, if it is,"" said Chris Moore, the beverage director of the Ned NoMad, the hotel and members' club that contains Little Ned.Moore, whose resume includes stints at Coupette in London and Dante in Manhattan, is among the seasoned cocktail bartenders leading this explosion of variegated martinis. He recalls how the craft- cocktail community, which arose in the early 2000s, rejected the syrupy horrors of martinis past. Now, however, he is all in on martini experimentation.""I quite like the idea of taking a classic twist on a martini and twisting it again,"" he said. ""Now I see the reinvention of the apple martini.""Julie Reiner, a leader in the craft-cocktail business for two decades, has tried to improve the appletini more than once. She first attracted attention in 2000 at the Greenwich Village restaurant C3 for her improved version of that '90s bar staple, which used apple-infused vodka, apple liqueur and sparkling cider. At her SoHo bar Milady's, she serves apple martinis that are even better. One version contains apple- infused gin and vodka, as well as apple brandy and apple liqueur.She thinks the martini's resurgence is driven in large part by nostalgia. ""And there's something to be said for those flavors,"" she said. ""A lot of people want to drink martinis, but a classic martini is too strong for them.""The critical differences between yesterday's and today's creative martinis are skill and ingredients. While the old martinis were mostly made of vodka and cloying liqueurs, today's bartenders insist on higher-quality spirits and a drier touch.""It's not just any random ingredient served in a martini glass,"" said Sam Ross, an owner of Attaboy, who helped reopen Temple Bar in NoHo, which offers nearly a dozen martinis. ""This time around, it's based around clear spirits stirred with wine-based products,"" he said, in the same way that the classic martini mixes clear gin or vodka with vermouth.Ross pointed out that 20 years ago, bartenders didn't have access to the wide variety of vermouths, sherries and other wine-based spirits imported today. This allows for a wider array of martinis that are nonetheless closer to the classic model than to the sweet potions of the 1990s.The martini-thirsty public has also played a part in creating this expanding martini universe. Ashley Santoro, the beverage director of Deux Chats in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knew her customers were going to order standard martinis anyway. There was no point in listing a classic version on the menu. The two martinis available are the Deux Chats Martini, made with gin, vermouth, sherry and celery brine; and the Kinky Martini, made with Thai-chile- infused vodka, a chile liqueur and two aperitifs.If the cocktail revival of the past two decades has been a history of bartenders trying to correct bad practices and misunderstood cocktails, perhaps the new martinis are the ultimate correction, taking a chapter of cocktail history that had been written off as a train wreck and rewriting it as a creative embroidering on a classic.Naren Young, the creative director of Sweet Liberty, sees value in making a great version of something that is often made poorly. ""Maybe I can drink a good apple martini,"" Young said. ""Maybe I can have a great lemon drop. There's nothing wrong with it if it's done well.""",NEUTRAL,2

But it could also be COVID and we are going to have to do a swab for you and run that test because you have a lot of symptoms that overlap with those symptoms. Um, and then, so just going off of that, we'll wait for the swabs to come back. If they come back positive, we will notify public health and they'll do a trace to see where you could have gotten this infection from. And then meanwhile, we do suggest that you isolate for two weeks so that you don't spread the illness, and even if the swab comes back negative, there is still a chance that you may have COVID and it's a false negative test. So we'll start there. If it turns out you don't have any of those viral illnesses and you have more of a, you know, bacterial picture, we can work you up for that and prescribe antibiotics.

985,"Scotland's world-renowned food and drink sector has more firms than any other industry in a key compilation of the country's top 100 companies.And two of Scotland's biggest Scotch whisky distillers have made the overall top five.Accountancy giant Grant Thorntoncompiled the Scotland Limited Report 2024 using the most recent publicly available accounts of Scotland's best-performing private concerns, as of March 31, 2024, with the ranking based on a hybrid measure of data, including turnover and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Ebitda).Seventeen of the firms in the top 100 are food and drink companies, and between them turned over ¬£7 billion in their most recent financial years, with an aggregate Ebitda of ¬£1.12bn. The 17 firms employ a combined 25,976 people and have net assets of ¬£4.4bn, the report found.William Grant &amp; Sons, which produces spirits such as The Glenfiddich, Balvenie and Hendrick's Gin, came in at number four in the top 100, with Ebitda of ¬£422 million and turnover of ¬£1.72bn in its most recent accounts. The distiller's results brought profits back in line with 2019, before the impact of the pandemic and subsequent global supply-chain challenges.The company, which is registered in Dufftown, Speyside, was found by Grant Thornton to have been the fourth-biggest firm in Scotland by turnover, Ebitda, and net assets, with the latter valued at ¬£2.03bn.Fellow Scotch whisky distiller Edrington, which owns The Macallan and Highland Park single malts, was number five in the top 100 ranking. The Glasgow-based firm's most recent accounts reveal Ebitda of ¬£442m on turnover ¬£1.08bn in 2023. It had net assets of ¬£1.21bn.Outside the top 10, the next highest food and drink firm in the ranking was Farmfoods. The frozen food specialist, which has more than 300 shops throughout the UK, was placed in 13th position, following a year that saw it continue to trade profitably despite increasing cost pressures. The retailer's most recent accounts available at Companies House show that it made a pre-tax profit of ¬£22.2m in the year ended December 31, 2022, up from ¬£20.5m.Baxters, the long-established Speyside-based canned soup maker, came in at number 20, followed by Ian Macleod Distillers, owner of whisky brands Glengoyne, Tamdhu and Rosebank, at 36. The top 50 also included potato grower Albert Bartlett (40), online butcher JW Galloway (43) and Browns Food Group (48).Other food and drink companies to make this year's top 100 are The Albex group (62), United Wholesale Cash &amp; Carry (64), CJ Lang (75), Walker's Shortbread (76), United Wholesale Grocers (83), Highland Spring (86), BrewDog (88), McQueens Dairies (92), wholesaler JW Filshill (94), and AG Restaurants (98).The Grant Thornton report found that only one of the 17 food and drink companies in the top 100 is private equity-backed, reflecting the number of large, family-owned groups operating in the sector. Aggregate debt in the food and drink sector was measured at ¬£1.83bn.The industry was found to be one of three sectors with the greatest proportion of overseas revenues, alongside manufacturing and engineering, and business support services. More than 40% of revenue generated by food and drink firms was earned overseas, found the report, which said that 12 of the 17 food and drink concerns in the top 100 export to overseas markets.The report states: ""Turnover from overseas markets in aggregate is up 32% during the year, against a backdrop of total turnover for the top 100 up 26%. This indicates that growing international markets remained a key focus for many of Scotland's largest companies.""",NEUTRAL,2

1239,"Blood Stealer CultPlanet B1004. That is the name by which the galaxy knows this world. Literally a no name ball of dirt, with small oceans, mostly filled with uneven hill sides and thick forests, where the local rivers run like veins. The imperium knows it as a feudal world which pay its tithes, albeit with some difficulty, and even when they do, their resources are found lacking. A useless world, allowed to live only by the grace of the God Emperor.The people of the world call it Nocterw√§cht.The people mostly live quiet lives, tending to their crop, their farms and livestock, while a few brave souls strike out to trade between villages. The nobility is unorganized to say the least, but they get along. Barons and Lords meet on many occasions in neighboring estates for grand galas, or at least, grand by the definition of this world, where they mingle and talk amongst themselves. Were pleasantries are exchanged almost as much as backroom deals, coin, and substances.In these circles, you more or less know everyone who attends these galas. Yet none are more well known than Lady Sophia, of the Southeast Mountains. She is quiet, almost blending into the background, if not for those eyes and smile. So soft, warm, almost inviting. It's intimidating to approach her, yes. When seeing her from afar, you might feel a tightening sensation in your chest. A trembling in your legs. As she swirls her glass of red wine absentmindedly, and no doubt dreaming of the food her household is so infamous for, a primal fear may overtake you. Like a rabbit staring at a wolf slowly consuming its kill.But all of that melts away, once you approach her, and she smiles at you. Men and women alike have spoken about how talking with her is soothing beyond any aphrodisiac. How her quiet voice sends shivers down their spine, so slow, soft, mesmerizing. Enchanting almost, some would even say.Despite her talking to many, nobody can truly claim to know her. Some have met with her on outings, some even courted her even. But details are...hard to recall.Everyone knows of her father. Well, in passing, that is. The reclusive lord is seldom known to leave his manor, which he claim decades ago, if not centuries. No one knows how old he is, but it is a testament to the family's wealth that he has managed to get so many rejuvenating treatments, a rarity amongst the nobles of this world. Yet it is strange how nobody has ever seen him take off world...Probably the percs of having one of your daughters be an inquisitor. Or well, an apprentice she was, before she was adopted by the Master of the Manor. So taken was she by him when she visited the planet, on some sort of wild goose chase the inquisition is so well known on going, that she wished to become part of his family. Ever since, some of her ex-colleagues have come to see her. Some very angry. Most only need a conversation with Sophia to leave though. But some are...more persistent. Chasing after the Lord and his Barony relentlessly. But, they must be satisfied at some point. Cause they are never seen again.The nobles cannot understand why their peasants are so afraid of the Barony. They speak of mindless hordes of thralls, men of pale skin and smiles too wide, too sincere when they describe consuming the flesh of the living and harvesting their blood. Hulking behemoths, conniving highway men, and too many armed monsters with too many teeth lurking in the shadows, moving between trees at blurring speeds that none but the Emperor's Angels should be able to move. Launching from their hiding space to consume your blood, before they take you, and you disappear into the night.Baseless rumors and superstitions. Sophia herself said so.Their domain is known for its mutations yes, but nothing vile or inhuman about it. And their people do possess a grim sense of humor, but who doesn't in this world. Her brother is a prime example. Master Gin is an unpleasant, but brilliant young man, who looks far older than he is. The stress from running a multi-planetary business, no doubt.The GSC, or rather, Gin's Stellar Crust, boomed in popularity quickly, for both its taste and affordability. You would not know it from looking at him, but the young lord is apparently a pretty good Sheff, utilizing an old instruction book to make a delicacy called 'Pi-zza'. Using a homemade recipe to create one of the most delicious foods on this side of the galaxy, a favorite amongst workers apparently, delivered by truck, or bike, right to them.So what if they are rumored to use some rare herbs that are found on their mountain side, said to quiet the minds of men, make them simple? What if your skin might turn a little paler if you eat it? What if you find the Lady a little more attractive, a little more alluring, to the point you can hear her voice at night, when alone in your room, or even in your dreams, once you consume this nectar in solid form.Coincidences. Here say. Superstitions.Don't get focused on the blabbering's of the uneducated mashes, warning you against it. Focus on the Crust. Focus on the Sauce. That delicious, delicious sauce.All is quiet on planet B1004.  All is quiet on this side of the galaxy.There is nothing suspicious here.  Nothing to worry about.Just eat.Eat.**Eat**",NEUTRAL,2

1493,"Yeah, so definitely this is something that is what we call Jumpers knee. It's fairly common, uh, amongst younger athletes, especially those that play sports like volleyball or basketball. But right now we don't really need to do any kind of imaging or anything like that. It seems like you're in the earlier phases and it's good that you came in. We definitely do need to manage it with some conservative management where we're going to keep having taking a look at it as well as I would recommend icing it every, like for half an hour, like around four to six times a day, especially after you're doing your activities. Then you can you can take the, continue taking the Tylenol and Advil, as well. As long as you're following the maximum amount per day depending on if you're taking extra strength Tylenol for example versus the regular strength. And then I will also refer you to some physiotherapy that will kind of a teach you some strengthening and stretching exercises that you can do to help what we call like that you will you might be having is just um some inflammation in your patellar tendon, right below your patella. So we need to strengthen the muscles around it. So we'll do some referral to physiotherapy and then we'll see how you you do based on all those treatment options and then if it gets worse and if or if it doesn't get better, we might need to do some imaging, either ultrasound or an MRI and then see where to go from there.

1797,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

Easy Plus package would be alcohol up to $10 so Jose Quervo 1800 tequila, Ketel One vodka, and semi-higher end wine and beer. Premium package covers the premium booze (Patron or Don Julio tequila, almost all gins and highest end beer and wine). We were fine with the easy plus. IIRC Most of the drinks of the day were $10.

In a frank and funny chat with Metro, EastEnders icon Natalie Cassidy, 41, talks about the family and friends who make sure her feet are firmly on the ground, overcoming loss and what the chances are of her appearing on I'm A Celeb‚Ä¶Have you always been able to keep your feet on the ground? You grew up from such a young age in the public eye... Yeah, I have. I would put it down to a very normal working-class upbringing. You know, my dad was a newsagent, and my mum was a housewife. I had a lovely childhood. I've got two older brothers and a family around me that keep me grounded. Siblings, nieces, nephews - they all do it. And daughters now [Eliza, 13, and Joanie, seven] who like to tell me, 'It's really boring what you do, Mummy' [laughs].What is the most meaningful life lesson you've learned over the years?One of my favourite sayings is: what other people think of you is none of your business. You need to keep in your lane, do what you think is right, and don't be jealous of other www.people.Be grateful for who you are, and what you've got. If you can get up in the morning and be kind to people and stay true to yourself, that's all you can do. That's what I try to do.And what about the biggest challenge you have had to overcome?The biggest thing for me is the loss of my parents. I lost my mum [Evelyn, following a battle with cancer] when I was 19, and I lost my dad [Charles] a few years ago. I try to remain - to get through grief and turn that into a positive, and remember great things about them, and to know that you've done your best, that's a big life lesson for me.I'm 38 and currently living at home with my folks, who are in their 70s, and you just start to see mortality slowly but surely creeping in...My dad lived with me. He moved in with me in the last six years of his life. I was very, very close to my dad after losing my mum, and then I had him stay with me. So, I understand fully where you are, but they're young, don't worry about it, don't panic too much. It's a gift. Listen, I did everything for my dad, and I have no regrets. I just miss him, which is very special.You recently celebrated your 41st birthday - belated congratulations. How do you feel about getting older?I don't really think about it. Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't. I'm happy, in terms of how confident I am in myself, and the friends and family I've got around me. I split my time very well now. I can count my best friends on one hand. I know what I want to do, and I say no to things if I want to say no to them. I've probably become a bit more intolerant of things that I don't like as I get older. You become braver as a person the more life you've experienced. I just want to try and carry on doing what I'm doing.How much of a kick do you still get from playing Sonia Fowler in EastEnders? I absolutely adore it. I've been doing it for over 30 years. It's my comfort really. It is somewhere I go and feel at home. I'm honoured to still have the part and that Sonia is growing older, like me. It's just a great place to work.Have any behind-the-scenes moments really stayed with you?I'd say when Prince Charles and Camilla visited us for the [Queen's platinum] jubilee episodes. They were fantastic, and obviously they weren't king and queen at the time. That was a wonderful day, to meet them and have them there. We were all dressed up for the jubilee, and it was snowing for a while. So, that's something to remember, when you're in your nurse's outfit and it's freezing cold!Which EastEnders legend would you like to see return to the show?Oh gosh! To be honest, I would say Pam St Clement, [who played] Pat Butcher. She died in the show [in 2012] but I think if you had Pat turn up with the earrings and knock on the door, it'd light the place up!What other acting ambitions do you have? Is there a dream role in mind? I can see myself in a gritty drama. I've been watching Slow Horses and The Gentlemen, and I watch those and think, I could be an East End gangster, that'd be good. Or even to play someone downstairs in a house in Victorian times, being a cook who's cheeky. I also love comedy‚Ä¶ I suppose I've never had the time to explore it, but yeah, I'd love to do some kind of sitcom. That's my dream.You also host podcast OffThe Telly with Joanna Page. What are your TV turn-ons and offs?Turn-ons would be any cooking programme. I know people think that's dull but for me, comfort watching isMasterChef, or a little bit of Jamie Oliver. And turn-offs? I am not one for true crime‚Ä¶ or the afternoon-y Homes Under The Hammer. I'm also not a massive fan of medical dramas, but only because when I watch them, I go, 'I don't know how you're learning those lines, all those medical terms.'Last year your name was being bandied about for I'm A Celebrity‚Ä¶ Get Me Out Of Here! Would you ever be tempted? Sometimes I think, oh, that would be fun. And then a bluebottle will fly into my bedroom and I'm screaming. I think, what are you talking about, you're never going to do it. I always say I'd be the first celeb to die on live TV [laughs]. As much as it's a fantastic show, and never say never, if I needed to do it, I might have to, however I would make a real fool of myself‚Ä¶ funny is one thing, desperately, uncontrollably scared is another!Now this is something I'm actively trying to manifest‚Ä¶ there is talk of there being a celeb spin-offof The Traitors UK, and I think you'd be great!I would love that. Sign me up. I'd be a Traitor. It's more fun, isn't it? But yeah, I'd be up for it tomorrow, in a heartbeat.How do you like to unwind?With [partner] Marc, and a gin and tonic. Get the kids to bed, and play our records. We've got an eclectic range of music. For my birthday, Marc bought me a rare collection of Oasis B-sides.Do you have any other hobbies?Going into London on my own and wandering around art galleries.What is your most annoying habit?I snore - I sound like Darth Vader when I go to sleep, which isn't great. I do bite my nails, but usually pop on an acrylic to stop that habit. And I say 'umm' a lot.What is your pet peeve?Rudeness and lateness. People being rude for no reason and being late is not acceptable‚Ä¶ being short, sharp, no eye contact, not saying hello properly. I know we're all heads down on our phones, but let's bring our heads up and chat to people. Let's have a bit of social contact. I think it's important.Can you share with me an unpopular opinion?For somebody who has been in EastEnders for 30 years‚Ä¶ I'm not really a fan of pie and mash!That could be a career-destroying admission![Laughs] I just don't like pies and I'm not a fan of mash, so putting the two together - I'm not saying I wouldn't eat it, but it just doesn't excite me.Have you ever had an awkward showbiz run-in?I was at a soap awards, and I had a corset dress - in my bigger days - and I had it too tight, and I thought I was going to faint.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

3834,"A VAPING industry representative has defended the use of vapes with sweet flavours like bubblegum, saying ""adults like flavours just as much as young people do"".John Dunne, director general UK Vaping Industry Association, told MSPs that he drank bubblegum-flavoured gin in order to illustrate his point.However, MSPs on Holyrood's Health Committee were sceptical of the industry's efforts to make their products less attractive to children.MSPs were scrutinising Holyrood's consent for UK legislation called the Tobacco and Vapes Bill.The UK-wide legislation will mean youngsters born on or after January 1 2009 will never legally be able to buy cigarettes.Sales of vapes to under-18s are already illegal, but there are concerns sweet-flavoured products are leading to children taking up vaping.Health Committee convener Clare Haughey asked Mr Dunne why vapes with flavours such as candyfloss and bubblegum are on the market, alongside bright and colourful packaging.He replied: ""I'm 57 years of age, I like bubblegum-flavoured gin, for instance, and I have candyfloss-flavoured vodka in my home.""He claimed: ""Adults like flavours just as much as young people do.""Green MSP Gillian Mackay said she had Googled some of the UK Vaping Industry's members and found they were selling flavours ""clearly targeted at children"" - including one which appeared to reference Supermix, a type of Haribo pack.Mr Dunne said his organisation had encouraged its members to introduce ""blander"" packaging and remove child-friendly names.He claimed that the issue of youth vaping had been around for two or three years, whereas the flavoured products have been available for longer.Dr Garth Reid, a consultant at Public Health Scotland, later told the committee: ""We know that flavours are something that entice children to start vaping.""Sheila Duffy, chief executive of the campaign group ASH Scotland, said the issue of advertising to children needed to be dealt with ""urgently"".",NEUTRAL,2

Most likely in this case, the anterior cruciate ligament, but just to make sure we will need to do an MRI of your knee and see which ligament is affected and to what extent. Uh, and usually with the with the depending on what we find on the MRI sometimes it can be just conservative management, but however oftentimes you do require surgery, so it would be. Just a surgery where we put kind of like a scope in into your knee and through the scope we try to fix the ligament. So yeah first, we'll just do the MRI and see to what extent your knee injury is and how how affected the ligaments are, and then we'll go from there. Does that sound OK?",DOCTOR,1

Um and we diagnose that on history and physical exam, um but if after we try some management and treatment plans, it doesn't go away and it persists for more than eight weeks, we do recommend imaging, including an MRI. So uh in terms of management for right now, um modified activity at work, um some short term bed rest, uh very short term though um and bed rest is only really recommended if you have severe back pain and muscle spasms, um and you definitely shouldn't be doing that for more than like 24 to 48 hours, and physical activity can help, um so referral to physical therapy or physiotherapy um can help in rehab and they'll give you some exercises that you can try at home to kind of um strengthen those muscles. And then ice and heating packs um temporarily can help, uh medications like NSAIDs can help as well with the inflammation. Um so we'll try these things out and then we'll continue to follow up.

I'm not T2D and honestly have no health issues - as of yet.I just placed my online order for 2.5mg of Mounjaro that arrives in three days! ¬£153 (ouch) but I hope it is worth it! I have been yo-yoing weight the last 9 years. I lost 100lbs between the age of 23-25 and kept it at 63-70kg until I fell pregnant with my first child at age 29. My body's metabolism changed (maybe the hormones?) with my previous two pregnancies it took me over a year to start losing weight - I have three kids and my last was born 1 year ago. I've gained 40kg üòî I had worked so hard to get down to 80kg before my last pregnancy only to put it back on and more! I'm back to my heaviest weight and miserable. I read the book Fast,Eat, Repeat by Gin Stephens and chose to do clean intermittent fasting as my lifestyle. It's been great so far but scale and body isn't changing after 3 months.My diet:I don't drink, I don't have any liquid that isn't water or coffee or tea. I've been intermittent fasting 18/6 for the last 3 months - which I find easy to do but still don't make the healthiest choices when I have my eating window open. I'm hoping that going into Mounjaro will curb these cravings for carbs and focus on my healthy fats and proteins. I cook most my meals and know a lot about healthy food choices and can do it easily if I don't have the food noise there. I exercise moderately but will do more as the weight drops and I'm more comfortable. Currently I do one exercise class a week + run around after three kids and a dog. I am a swimmer and plan to get back into swimming 4 days a week /40-50 laps in 30 minutes.Anyone a intermittent faster before going into Mounjaro? What advice can you tell me?

5769,"photo by Alex Aigner ""‚Ä¶a sound straddling the lines between noise rock, hardcore punk, and sludge‚Ä¶"" ‚Äì No Echo As Vienna, Austria-based DESOLAT prepares for the June 14th release of their second LP, Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die, through long-running noise rock mongers Reptilian Records, No Echo today premieres the band's video for ""This Band Is Your Yoga."" DESOLAT's crushing Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die deploys eight ripping tracks with a riotous, relentless momentum, while lyrical undercurrents of political unrest, societal disgust, and a live fast/die young callousness shred their way through. The record's artwork and title were inspired by Texas' Brutal Juice and their 1995 Alternative Tentacles-released masterpiece, I Love The Way They Scream When They Die. Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die was recorded and mixed by Rainer Sp√§nle at Cosmix Studios in Vienna, mastered by Dan Swan√∂ at Unisound (Opeth, Edge Of Sanity, Bloodbath), with design elements by Lisl Matzer. The track ""Great White Northern Shitlicker"" features saxophone by Michael Masen. This is music for fans of Unsane, Neurosis, Entombed, Iron Monkey, Helmet, Discharge, H√ºsker D√º, Sonic Youth, and The Jesus Lizard. Get sick! Musically, DESOLAT pays their respect to their all-time heroes like Nomeansno, Copshootcop, Alice Donut, and Swing Kids, as exemplified in ""This Band Is Your Yoga."" The video simply showcases a clique of punks having fun for a day. The script, camera, and direction for the video were handled by Alfred Satani. The band writes, ""While the song's lyrics ‚Äì 'wake up in speed, in light, in cold, and rise up indeed, before you fall' ‚Äì are a little poem that speaks of empowerment and the frequent reality of decline, it is thwarted by samples of John Boorman's 'Zardoz,' a dystopian delusion that serves as a social commentary on class difference and dehumanization by intellectual dazzlement, drawn through a lush dose of nihilism. Empowerment, nihilism, and confusion; welcome to the anti-esoteric community of faith: DESOLAT!"" No Echo writes with the video's public unveiling, ""DESOLAT is a power trio with a sound straddling the lines between noise rock, hardcore punk, and sludge‚Ä¶ The DESOLAT dudes cite Nomeansno, Alice Donut, and Copshootcop as key points of inspiration to their sound."" Summon your inner nihilist and pogo until your legs snap to DESOLAT's ""This Band Is Your Yoga"" video at No Echo RIGHT HERE. Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die will be released on Red Transparent vinyl including a download card through US noise rock juggernaut Reptilian Records and digitally through Austria's Bloodshed 666 Records on June 14th. Find preorders at the Reptilian webshop HERE and Bandcamp where ""(Gin) Tonic Youth"" is playing HERE. Austria and Vienna are better known for The Sound Of Music, Mozart, Empress Sissi, and some sense of cozy beauty than grim music. But Unsane's Chris Spencer barely survived an act of violence there, Henry Rollins wrote about being impressed by the borderline assertiveness of the local punks, their all-time favorites are the infamous Pungent Stench, and when the Viennese Actionism was up to mischief in the 1960s, it drove worldwide astonishment. There's legendary fields of unpleasant deviance and transgression in Vienna, and that's where DESOLAT stirs around. Established in 2018, DESOLAT's grimy noise rock is rooted in hardcore/punk and infused with elements of sludge, crust, and death metal created by three veterans of the Viennese DIY anarcho punk scene, current and former members of Phal:Angst, Cyruss, Dim Prospects, La Ligne Maginot, Gfrast, Face The Owl, Radikalkur, E.M.S., and others. The band's beginning days were cut short as COVID-19 lockdowns were put into place after playing only three shows. Nevertheless, they have since managed to release two EPs and one LP, with album number two, Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die, now on the verge of release. photo by Paayarazzi https://med-user.net/~desolat https://desolatvienna.bandcamp.com http://www.reptilianrecords.com https://reptilianrecords.bandcamp.com https://www.facebook.com/ReptilianRecords https://www.instagram.com/reptilianrecords https://www.youtube.com/@reptilianrecords1248 http://www.bloodshed666.net https://www.facebook.com/bloodshed666records https://www.instagram.com/bloodshed666records The post DESOLAT: No Echo Premieres ""This Band Is Your Yoga"" Video By Austrian Noise Rock/Hardcore Punk Trio; Dan Swan√∂-Mastered Get Sick And Let Me Watch You Die LP Nears Release On Reptilian Records first appeared on Earsplit Compound.",NEUTRAL,2

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

And it sounds like she had a viral infection last week with the cough, fever and and runny nose and her. She was feeling a bit warm and maybe feverish today as well, which could be a sign with the lower kind of slightly elevated temperature, pointing towards transient synovitis, which is a condition that will be self limiting and can use anti- inflammatories to help with the pain such as ibuprofen, but also something that would be important to rule out would be is septic arthritis because it could could lead to damage of the joint, but this will be lower on the differential and then finally something to consider is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. And, but this would be more of progressive  onset, but if she's not getting any better and or if she becomes more sick like develops a really high fever or a red hot swollen joint, then we'd be thinking more along the lines of septic arthritis and we want to reassess.",DOCTOR,1

6422,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

6468,"Once upon a time, in the quaint seaside town of Plymouth, there lived a man named James. James was a lover of adventure and a connoisseur of fine cocktails, particularly one named Devil's Point Punch. This tantalizing concoction, made with Plymouth Gin and a blend of tropical fruits, had become James's signature drink, a taste of paradise in every sip. One sunny afternoon, James set out on his small boat for a leisurely cruise around the picturesque coastline. As he basked in the warmth of the sun and the gentle sway of the waves, he decided to make himself a Devil's Point Punch to accompany his voyage. With the wind in his hair and the salt on his lips, he savored the exquisite flavors of guava, passion fruit, and gin, with just a hint of coffee to add depth to the experience. Lost in the moment, James sailed farther than he had intended and found himself nearing the enigmatic Drake's Island, a rugged outpost steeped in history and mystery. Entranced by its allure, James decided to explore its shores, unaware of the treacherous currents that surrounded it. As he wandered the rugged terrain of Drake's Island, James became disoriented, losing track of time and direction. Panic set in as he realized he was stranded on the island with no means of escape. But James was not one to give up easily. Drawing on his strength and determination, he resolved to swim back to the safety of Firestone Bay, where his home awaited. With every stroke, James fought against the churning waters, his muscles burning with exertion and his lungs straining for air. But he refused to succumb to despair, fueled by the thought of his loved ones waiting for him on the shore. Finally, after what felt like an eternity, James emerged from the water, battered but triumphant, on the shores of Firestone Bay. Exhausted but elated, he stumbled ashore and collapsed on the sand, his heart filled with gratitude for the gift of life and the chance to be reunited with his family. As James embraced his youngest son, tears of joy streaming down his face, he realized that the true treasure he possessed was not found in riches or material wealth, but in the love and bonds that bound him to his family. And so, with a trembling hand, he passed down the recipe for Devil's Point Punch to his son, knowing that it would serve as a reminder of their shared adventures and the strength of their bond. From that day forward, whenever James's family gathered to raise a toast in his honor, they would do so with glasses of Devil's Point Punch in hand, celebrating the indomitable spirit of a man who had braved the elements to return home and pass on his most precious inheritance‚Äîthe recipe for a cocktail that captured the essence of his adventurous soul.

6721,"Then.....I guess the story would go as planned, Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper and slowly becomes stronger, eventually getting to be as strong as a Menos Grande. Rukia wouldn't have an execution marker on her head so the Soul Society arc is just null and void, the Arrancar arc would probably not happen either but I suppose that, even tho the Vizarids were created originally by Aizen, they could do a major logic jump and have them be failed expirements by Mayuri, trying to create a better Shinigami, but ended up dumping them in Karakura Town, they end up being different characters, I guess, Shinji, Hiyori, and Rose is still among them but Kaname, Gin, and Komamura are the others, making the 13 Court Guards slightly reorganized with Aizen still being a Captain. The ""Hollow Reaper Arc"" would be the second arc, where the Vizarids would be the Antagonists. Ichigo will engage in a final fight against Gin, where Gin Activates his Hollowfied Bankai, which I'd imagine like Senbonzakura, but he controls several extending blades instead. Ichigo having trained for this fight, unlocked Hollowfication but not Bankai, as he hasn't seen much of what Bankai is, so he almost loses. But he somehow outwits Gin into Extending a blade into him, seeing that he puts his guard down when a blades done extending, Ichigo hits him point blank with a Hollowfied Shikai Getsuga Tensho.The next arc, the Soul Society puts a bounty on Ichigos head, along with every other Hollowfied Reaper after the ""death"" of Gin, this will take place roughly during the same period as the Full Bringer arc, so Ichigo has been a Soul Reaper for a while, but has yet to unlock Bankai, he's honed his Hollowfication, and can use it for approximately 7 days straight. He's roughly above where he was in the OG Soul Society arc without Bankai. Byakuya and Renji come to the land of the living to kill Ichigo, and Ichigo medium diffs Renji, but now he has to face Byakuya. Byakuya knows Ichigo has incredible endurance, so he whips out his Bankai immediately, this is Ichigos 3rd time seeing somebody else use a Bankai, but first one that wasn't Hollowfied, and was confused. Ichigo fights Byakuya to a stand still, Ichigo has the advantage, due to his stamina. Byakuya stops the fight and then proceeds to seemingly retreat with Renji without saying a word. Urahara takes Ichigo in and has Yoruichi teach him Bankai. Ichigo isn't doing very well, and eventually Byakuya comes back with Aizen. Ichigo hasn't achieved Bankai and has seemingly lost the ability to Hollowfy, due to Zangetsu getting in his head, twisting his perception. He fights against Byakuya to a low diff defeat, and Byakuya captures him and they prepare his execution. Ichigo has a bunch of dreams and meditates a shit ton, until hes up there about to be executed, he murmurs something under his breath as the attack is charging. Yamamoto seems taken aback by his words but no one else heard him. Ichigo yells loudly, ""Tensa Zangetsu White!!"" And bursts into a brightly lit Soul Reaper garb, White Clothes and bright red Sword, his eyes are Black with White Irises, and hair is black and his skin is seemingly pale and hes got a hole in his chest, with a horns pertruding from his skull. He's achieved, ""Bankai."" He then fights Yamamoto to a stand still, both using their Bankai to their fullest effect, and they are leveling the Seireitei. Ichigo then stops the fight saying, ""Is this what you wanted? To fight a kid because he's different than you? Is that what it means to be a 'Soul Reaper?' Because I'm done"" and rips off his Substitute Soul Reaper Badge and throws it at Yamamoto, ""Take this garbage"" and leaves.The next arc picks up after Ichigo leaves and he meets up with Komamura, Shinji, and Gin who's been alive but in hiding, and they say, ""A War is coming, I can feel it"" they say that some unknown people operating in Hueco Mundo with powers similar to Uryu are kidnapping the Vizarids, and have taken Chad and Uryu too. So Ichigo launches a kill quest, but not knowing what and where Hueco Mundo is, he confronts Urahara, who just so happens to know how to open a portal. They all go, including Urahara, and they see that the Quincys are everywhere. They seem to have familiar faces from the Soul Society as well, ones that trained because of Aizen originally, but trained this time bc of Ichigo, but were training for less time because of the time frame. The arc pretty much goes the same as before, other than the Soul Society doesn't have respect for Ichigo. Ichigo is stronger than he was in Canon at this point, bc he had just recieved his power back in Canon, so he gives pre Almighty Ywhach trouble, but his Bankai gets broken still, he gets taken to the Soul Kings Palace, Byakuya dies in this, Kenpachi gets Hollowfication along with his Bankai, from Mayuri, so he slaps. Rangiku and Gin reunite again. Komamura releases his Hollowfied Bankai, which is similar to his normal Bankai, but instead of a singular giant, he's got an army of him size Shogun. So he doesn't go to, and kill the big dog dude, I forget his name. Everything involving Squad Zero and the Soul Kings Palace stays the same, except Renji doesn't like Ichigo, and Rukia can't bridge that gap. They even start a real fight in the Palace and weren't stopped until everyone in the Palace was sure Ichigo was going to kill Renji. Ichigo recieves his new Sword, which is more reminiscent of his OG Bankai Sword, and he's got a glove to go along with it. His outfit is still white after his Bankai Awakening and his tossing of the Shinigami badge. He floors everyone in his path, besides Toshiro who gives him trouble only due to the fact of, ""He didn't want to fight a kid"". He stops Yhwach from killing the Soul King, but Yhwach is giving him trouble, when Aizen yells out, ""You have to go for the kill!"" Ichigo yells out, ""Bankai, TENSA ZANGETSU Hy≈çhaku sa reta kamigami (idk if that's right, but thanks Google Translate) similar to his last design by me, but he's just bathed in light, he lacks horns, and lacks a hole in his chest, but he gains long hair and loses his sword for an ethereal sword made of pure energy. It's similar to his Mugetsu design but bathed in White with White Clothes instead. And he just blitzes Ywhach who didn't stand a chance, and Ichigo kills him........I did not have to put this much effort into my answer, but it turned out into an interesting story imo.TL:DR, Aizen is just reduced to a background character who's strong, Ichigo recieves his powers in a different order than Canon",NEUTRAL,2

6862,"I'm in my 30s &amp; STILL don't know what to do if a bar doesn't have an actual cocktail menu üò≥üò≥üò≥ I'm a big fan of ""craft cocktails"" (I.e. fancy dranks), &amp; personally like spicy cocktails as well as unique, but well blended drinks (not too sweet, but definitely not alcohol forward), so I ask questions that help me better understand what they taste like.Drinks that are easy to get at bars with out a menu or cocktail list:üçªrum &amp; cokeüçªgin &amp; tonic (g&amp;t) - you can also ask for a lime or lemonüçªvodka &amp; cranberryüçª well whisky &amp; a soda water or sprite (also referred to as 7&amp;7 which is the type of whisky &amp; soda. If I order this I say wells 7&amp;7)üçªshot of ‚Ä¶. Anything (I prefer tequila &amp; ask for lime &amp; salt)üçªtequila &amp; soda (you can ask for a lime)Sometimes the type of liquor makes all the difference. People with refined taste would probably say it's not just sometimes. Since I'm no longer in college I do not buy Albertson's brand vodka anymore, bc I don't want something that tastes like I'm drinking hand sanitizer. I don't buy like crazy nice ($$) vodka either, just something decent.So, it's not just the drinks you'll end up wanting to try, but maybe being a little familiar with the liquor- if you're trying to intentionally build your knowledge &amp; experience. Sometimes you'll hear someone ask what the brand of wells (liquor) is for a drink, &amp; then maybe ask for a mid-level brand if the wells is just too scuzzy. Other drinks that are pretty popular:üçπ pi√±a colada üçπ espresso martini (this is not like an actual martini)üçπa martini (can be regular, dry, dirty‚Ä¶)üçπ cosmopolitan üçπmojitoüçπmargarita (my fave is a spicy marg)üçπtequila sunriseüçπmimosa (brunch drink)üçπbelini (brunch drink)üçπbloody Mary (brunch drink)üçπMoscow muleüçπWhite Russianüçπaperol spritzüçπold fashionedüçπNegroniüçπlemoncelloüçπPaloma üçπdaquariüçπlong island ice teaMany times places will do their own twist on the above (like do a Moscow mule- which normally has vodka- with tequila). You may or may not like that. Also, some places will make all the ingredients in house &amp; some will use a pre-brought mix. Some places just don't do a good job of making even regular cocktails. I've definitely bought drinks I know &amp; love before, &amp; then found them undrinkable.One more thing to add- what type of alcohol / drinks you like and how they affect you may (most likely will) be different from others, &amp; that's ok! I'd like to encourage you to drink water &amp; stay hydrated, eat plenty of food before you drink, bring snacks if you're out partying, &amp; take a water round fairly periodically. Pacing matters, &amp; you do not need to keep up with anyone else. I disagree with the person who said not to mix liquors. It is person dependent &amp; you'll need to figure out what works for you.Always, always, always cover your drink. Do not leave it unattended. &amp; Stay with your friends.

7353,"A North Shore woman whose cat turned up dead on the other side of town believes someone knows what happened to her much-loved pet ‚Äî and her neighbours believe more cats have been targeted.Alexia Welsh of Unsworth Heights, on Auckland's North Shore, told the Herald that she last saw Willow on April 14, when the cat snuck outside about 9pm.Welsh said her family kept their cats inside at night but Willow and another cat, Freddie, hopped out of the window that Sunday.Neither cat came home before dawn and then Freddie returned injured ‚Äî before Welsh received the call every pet owner dreads.At 1pm, the Henderson Animal Centre called to tell her that Willow had been found by one of its contractors on Mt Wellington Highway, a 30-minute drive away over the Harbour Bridge and down the Southern Motorway.The 5-year-old tortoiseshell's collar was missing and she was identified by microchip.Freddie's injuries were severe and he was rushed to a vet for treatment to his back leg and defensive wounds.Welsh said the vet told her the injuries were not consistent with a cat or dog fight and could have been caused by a trap, noting that other injuries to his face and front paws showed he had ""really fought hard to get away"".The vet told the Herald that they did not believe a gin trap-style device had been used but could not rule out another trap with a noose or a swinging door mechanism.""There's no way she would have gone willingly in anyone's car unless she'd been trapped,"" Welsh said of Willow. ""She's very timid."" Welsh believes that one of her neighbours is targeting local cats.She lives near the busy Northern Motorway and doesn't believe Willow would have strayed into traffic if she was released in Mt Wellington.""I shudder to even think whether they've just chucked her out of the car,"" Welsh told the Herald.She said Willow had previously gone missing for four days, returning home ""very scared"" and ""jumping at any slight noise"", with Welsh wondering if she was caught and released to ""teach her a lesson"".Willow is not the first of her pets to go missing.Her cat Mickey went missing in February and has still not been found.She has appealed online for information but was blunt in her message to her community after Willow's death.""This is not purely coincidence, especially given the timing between Willow's death and Freddie's injury.We strongly believe there is someone in the neighbourhood who is potentially trapping, dumping, and disposing of local cats."" A Facebook group for the neighbourhood has seen multiple posts from residents whose cats have gone missing or returned home with injuries.Some residents spoken to by the Herald referenced anonymous posts made to the local Facebook group purportedly by a person threatening roaming neighbourhood cats.""You love your cats so keep them home,"" the message read.The message went on to say that the cats were catching birds but not targeting rats, so rat traps and rat poison would be placed. ÔøΩSo please keep your cat at home to not be hurt by the traps."" A woman who lives a street away from Welsh shared details of her own missing pet.""One night he didn't come back.The days went by and he didn't come back,"" she told the Herald.An SPCA spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the incidents.There's no way she would have gone willingly in anyone's car unless she'd been trapped.Cat owner Alexia Welsh",NEUTRAL,2

8166,"[Updated from May, 2019] I began making pine cone jam in May 2019 (I posted about it @66squarefeet on Instagram) after a wonderful shoreline walk on the edges of New York City, where I noticed tiny-tiny baby pine cones. I was actually hunting for pine pollen, but these petite cones intrigued me. They were much tinier than the larger green cones I'd used before to make fermented syrup. I collected a little bagful. Looking for ideas back at home, I chanced upon a reference to this jam, and one helpful recipe that noted Georgian heritage. I also scoured searched my Russian and Georgian cookbooks, but came up with nothing. At the time there was very little online. Although I did find bottles of pricey mugolio. It's the richly-flavored syrup that forms during cooking the young pine cones and sold in Italy - the name taken from the pine species Pinus mugo. My first Instagram posts about the jam exploded, and the recipe I posted back then may have nudged things along quite rapidly, online: You will now find many more recent posts and videos. Russians like it. Eastern Europeans like it. Turks seem to like it. Pine cone jam (sometimes the resulting syrup is referred to and sold as pine honey) is considered treat and medicine. Used for coughs. The flavor is tartly sweet, resinous, and the ""honey"" is like molasses licked from a spoon in a pine forest. It's really nice in drinks. And it's hard to imagine that the hard little cones become soft and chewable after cooking, but they do. A traditional Caucasian and Russian way to enjoy them is as a medicinal spoonful stirred into hot black tea. I like them dotted sparingly on crunchy toast atop labneh. Their honey-slash-syrup is delicious roasted with carrots and other root vegetables, stirred into the pan juices to pour over pan-seared pork chops, or duck breast (perhaps deglazed with some bourbon or fruity vinegar), or for dessert, mixed with the first strawberries. There is always ice cream! To make pine syrup gin or vodka, add a quarter cup of the syrup with cones to 2 cups of the liquor. Leave for a day, shaking now and then, until the syrup has dissolved. Strain and bottle. It makes noteworthy seasonal cocktails. The pine cones I collect are mostly from exotic Japanese black pine (Pinus thunbergii), popular in local seashore landscape and park plantings because of their salt-tolerance. Native pitch pine (Pinus rigida) occurs, too (its little cones are very sharp and rough on the fingers). You want immature, small cones, green inside. While you work, it helps to have rubbing alcohol handy: Your fingers get very sticky, and the alcohol is very effective at dissolving the resin. For clean up after cooking, use rubbing alcohol, again, or mineral oil, to dissolve the very tenacious resin residue on the edges of your pot and any implements you use. The first time I made the jam I experimented with five different batches. For the first three I boiled the cones in water (to remove some resin), then another three times in syrup, in the tradition of Russian varenye, where entire fruits are cooked and cooled - important - multiple times in syrup. I also boiled four and five times, and for the final batch made the jam without the water bath, and using honey instead of sugar. That last version was much more resinous when cool, above! It all got stuck. I liked them all, but four seems the magic number, to me. The point is that the jam needs to come to a boil often enough for the green cones to be pleasantly chewable, so the number of boil-cools will vary, depending on big your baby pine cones are. Do not skip the cooling. It's time-consuming, but will result in delicious pine cones, rather than hard nuggets. Pine Cone Jam For three 1-cup capacity jars of pine cone jam you need: 8 oz (about 2.25 cups) finger-nail-sized immature pine cones* 6 cups water 2 cups sugar *I've made jam with much larger cones, too. Their size matters less than green-ness. If the baby cones still have a piece of stem attached, remove it. Left on it will become tough during the cooking process. Sometimes I skip this part but always regret it! (It's sometimes easier to do this after the boiling step, below.) The Pre-Boil: Place the pine cones in a pot, cover with water and bring to a boil. Cook at a gentle boil for 5 minutes. Turn the heat off. A layer of resin will collect on the surface like a little oil slick - carefully scoop his layer off, and discard. Then drain the pine cones. The Jam: Once all the water is poured off, add the 2 cups of sugar and the 6 cups of water to the pot with the boiled cones. Stir. Return to the stove and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so that the liquid simmers. Cook at a simmer for 5 minutes. Turn off heat and cool completely. When the mixture is cool, bring to a boil again, for 1 minute. Turn off and cool. Bring to a 1-minute boil for a third time, turn off the heat, then cool again. Repeat these steps until the liquid has transformed from watery to syrupy. Now test a cone. Is it chewable? If it is you can stop, and bottle the cones with their dark 'honey' in sterile jars. Or repeat the boil-cool steps until they have softened more and the honey is thick. It can take from five to eight boils, in my experience. _____________ Find more wild foods and recipes in my book: Forage, Harvest, Feast - A Wild-Inspired Cuisine",NEUTRAL,2

The 17 firms employ a combined 25,976 people and have net assets of 4.4bn, the report found.William Grant &amp; Sons, which produces spirits such as The Glenfiddich, Balvenie and Hendrick-s Gin, came in at number four in the top 100, with EBITDA of 422m and turnover of 1.72 billion in its most recent accounts. The distiller-s results brought profits back in line with 2019, before the impact of the pandemic and subsequent global supply-chain challenges.William Grant, which is registered in Dufftown, Speyside, was found by Grant Thornton to have been the fourth biggest firm in Scotland by turnover, EBITDA, and net assets, with the latter valued at 2.03bn.Fellow Scotch whisky distiller Edrington, which owns The Macallan and Highland Park single malts, was number 5 in the top-100 ranking. The Glasgow-based firm-s most recent accounts show reveal EBITDA of 442m on turnover 1.08bn in 2023. It had net assets of 1.21bn.READ MORE: Cara Laing takes 'natural step' at family whisky firmOutside the top 10, the next highest food and drink firm in the ranking was Farmfoods. The frozen food specialist, which has more than 300 shops throughout the UK, was placed in 13th position, following a year that saw it continue to trade profitably despite increasing cost pressures. The retailer-s most recent accounts available at Companies House show that it made a pre-tax profit of 22.2m in the year ended December 31, 2022, up from 20.5m.Baxters, the long-established Speyside-based canned soup maker, came in at number 20, followed by Ian Macleod Distillers, owner of whisky brands Glengoyne, Tamdhu and Rosebank, at 36. The top 50 also included potato grower Albert Bartlett (40), online butcher JW Galloway (43) and Browns Food Group (48).Other food and drink companies to make this year-s top 100 are The Albex group (62), United Wholesale Cash &amp; Carry (64), CJ Lang (75), Walker-s Shortbread (76), United Wholesale Grocers (83), Highland Spring (86), BrewDog (88), McQueens Dairies (92), JW Filshill (94), and AG Restaurants (98).The Grant Thornton report found that only one of the 17 food and drink companies in the top 100 is private equity backed, reflecting the number of large, family-owned groups operating in the sector. Aggregate debt in the food and drink sector was measured at 1.83bn.READ MORE: Hunter Laing toasts record profits as Islay debut nearsThe industry was found to be one of three sectors with the greatest proportion of overseas revenues, alongside manufacturing and engineering, and business support services. More than 40% of revenue generated by food and drink firms was earned overseas, found the report, which said that 12 of the 17 food and drink concerns in the top 100 export to overseas markets.The report states: -Turnover from overseas markets in aggregate is up 32% during the year, against a backdrop of total turnover for the top 100 up 26%.

8886,"Track 5 from his debut solo album released in 1975 copyright Nemperor Records. It was recorded at the Record Plant in L.A., Electric Lady Studios in NYC and Trident Studios in London. Tommy Bolin was born and raised in Sioux City, Iowa and began playing in bands at the age of thirteen. He moved to Boulder, Colorado in his late teens and joined a band called Zephyr, which featured a dynamic female singer. He went on to do a lot of session work and became Joe Walsh's replacement in James Gang for two albums in '73 &amp; '74. He also featured on a couple of jazz fusion albums, which was a genre he was passionate about. This album featured an impressive list of guest musicians including David Foster, drummer Jeff Porcaro, RIP and sax master David Sanborn, RIP. After his performance on Billy Cobham's fusion album ""Spectrum"" his fellow musicians recognized his talent and were eager to work with him to help him achieve his goals. When Tommy questioned his own vocal abilities he received advice and encouragement from none other than the Beach Boys, who gave him the confidence that he could pull it off. The album received enthusiastic reviews from critics and was praised for its use of reggae, Latin and jazz influences. Bolin had continued writing songs with his old friends Jeff Cook and John Tesar, who helped co-write half the album and all the songs are great. During the recording sessions, Bolin was contacted by David Coverdale who asked him if he'd like to join Deep Purple as Ritchie Blackmore's replacement. Blackmore had left Deep Purple after the ""Stormbringer"" album released the year before. Bolin accepted and soon after met the other members at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany to begin recording their next album ""Come Taste the Band."" He was excited by the opportunity and looked forward to making enough money to allow him to further his solo career. However, his commitment to Deep Purple took away his ability to promote ""Teaser"" with any kind of tour and he missed out on the exposure he would have gained from live performances. Deep Purple agreed to perform his songs ""Homeward Strut"" and ""Wild Dogs"" on their tour to help promote the album. Van Halen were known to perform ""The Grind"" in their early club days and Motley Crue covered ""Teaser"" for a charity album. Despite its stellar cast of musicians and great reviews, the album only reached No. 96 on the Billboard chart. Written by Tommy Bolin &amp; Jeff Cook and produced by Tommy Bolin &amp; Lee Kiefer. RIP Tommy Bolin, Jeff Porcaro &amp; David Sanborn. Featuring:Tommy Bolin - Lead vocals, lead &amp; rhythm guitarsSpecial Guests:Glenn Hughes - Co-Lead vocal on ""Dreamer""David Foster - Piano &amp; synthesizer on ""The Grind,"" ""Homeward Strut"" &amp; ""Dreamer""Jan Hammer - Synthesizer on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder,"" drums on ""People, People""Ron Fransen - Piano on ""Lotus""David Sanborn - Sax on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Stanley Sheldon - BassPaul Stallworth - Bass on ""Savannah Woman,"" Wild Dogs"" &amp; ""Lotus""Phil Collins - Percussion on ""Savannah Woman""Sammy Figeuroa - Percussion on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Rafael Cruz - Percussion on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Jeff Porcaro - Drums on ""The Grind,"" ""Homeward Strut,"" ""Dreamer"" &amp; ""Teaser""Prairie Prince - Drums on ""Savannah Woman"" &amp; ""Wild Dogs""Michael Walden - Drums on ""Marching Powder""Bobby Berge - Drums on ""Lotus""Dave Brown - Background vocals on ""The Grind""Lee Kiefer - Background vocals on ""The Grind""That woman's got a smile, puts you in a tranceAnd just one look at her makes you wanna danceThose dark and those red ruby lips, only a fool would pass you byWith just a hint of ruthlessness sparkling in her eyeShe's a teaser and she's got no heart at allShe's a teaser and she'll tempt you till you fallYeah, she'll tempt ya till ya fall, yeahShe sips gin from a teacup, wears them fancy clothesAnd somebody always knows her no matter where she goes(She'll talk to you in riddles that have no sense or rhyme)(And if you ask her what she means, says she don't got no time)She's a teaser and she's got no heart at allShe's a teaser and she'll tempt you till you fallYes, she'll tempt ya till ya fall, yeahShe's a teaser and she's got no heart at all(Yeah, she's a teaser and she'll tempt you till you fall)(She's a teaser and she's got no heart at all, yeah)Let's dig it, man",NEUTRAL,2

8971,"Evie likes her martinis and she likes them dirty. To that point: Vermouth by Evie (which is part of the Veso drinks company) has the brine built right in. Served solo, the impact is less powerful than you might expect. The product slightly blurs the line between a dry and a bianco vermouth, offering a hint of sweetness that helps temper the herbal notes in the experience. Crafted on top of gruner veltiner wine, the aromatics of bay leaf, lemon curd, and orange peel are all potent, layered through a gentle note of saline that comes across more like bread &amp; butter pickles than olive brine. Sharp and winey on the finish, it features the classic, slightly sour, oxidized quality that you expect from a bolder vermouth. It does pair really nicely with gin, and while it does imbue a martini with a bit of saltiness, if you're a true dirty martini enthusiast, you'll probably want to push your brine quotient considerably farther. Vermouth by Evie certainly makes for a nice head start, though. The only problem here is that, for some reason, Evie only made 300 bottles of this vermouth, and it's all sold out. If she makes another batch, well, now you know what to expect. 18% abv.

9150,"Exclusive Interview with Charles Milner: Chairman Middleton Railway Trust Conducted by Karen Beishuizen Photos courtesy of Charles Milner Established in 1758, the Middleton Railway holds the distinction of being the world's oldest continuously working railway. It was originally built to transport coal from the Middleton Colliery to the thriving markets of Leeds. Historic diesel locomotives built between 1932 and 1968 are used on Saturday and Wednesday trains and historic steam locomotives built between 1890 and 1955 on Sundays, Bank Holiday Mondays and on the Santa Specials. Moor Road Station has just the one platform. When trains are running 8 trains/day depart from the station to travel to Park Halt and there are the same number of trains arriving from Park Halt. Visitors can buy an all-day rover ticket which allows them to ride on as many trains as they wish. Middleton Railway is one of the most important places in the development of railways and railway locomotives and remarkably has operated every year since opening in 1758. Travelling on the Middleton Railway provides a direct link to the very earliest days of railways and steam locomotives. It should be place of pilgrimage for all bona fide railway enthusiasts. What the ride may lack in scenic splendor it more than makes up for with its history and whilst its locomotives may be small and lack the glamour of more famous mainline locomotives such as 'Flying Scotsman and 'Mallard' these little engines were the back bone of the manufacturing and extractive industries of three British Isles for more than a century and played a vital, if often unseen, role in the country's history. They alone are deserving of the visitor's attention. Go visit Middleton Railway and take a train ride! KB: Describe to the RSR readers how Middleton Railway was founded and by who? Coal has been mined one the Middleton Plateau to the South of Leeds since the medieval period. Originally coal was transported to the City of Leeds by packhorse and later by horse and cart along what were narrow and poorly maintained roads. By the 1750s the coal mines on the plateau were facing completion from coal mines located much closer to the River Aire whose owners could use water transport for the bulk of the journey from mine to the City of Leeds. The Brandling Family, who controlled the bulk of the mines on the plateau via the Middleton Estates, were familiar with the use of horse worked wagonways to transport coal from mines in Northumberland to the City of Newcastle and to the River Tyne. To cut their transport costs they decided to build a wagon way to connect their collieries to the City of Leeds which was their main market. The Middleton Estates applied for an Act of Parliament to give them the right to compulsory purchase the land needed to construct their wagonway from the Middleton Plateau into Leeds rather than follow the usual practice of negotiating with each of the landowners on the route into Leeds to secure a wayleave to build across their land which would have provided no long term security. The Act permitting the construction of what was called the Middleton Railway was passed in 1758 and the Railway was built in that year. Remarkably the Middleton Railway has operated every year since then making it the oldest continuously operated railway in the world and just as remarkably the Railway continues to operate under the applicable terms of the 1758 Act. The Middleton Railway was the first railway to be authorized by statute in the United Kingdom and possibly in the world. The 1758 Act provided the template for the subsequent Acts of Parliament which permitted the very rapid development of Railways in the United Kingdom in the 50 years after the opening of the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825 and was a crucial step in the development of a national transportation system. By 1810 the collieries on the Middleton Plateau were struggling once again because of the impact of the Napoleonic Wars. These created a huge demand for horses and for horse feed to meet the logistical demands of the British Armies fighting against Napoleon and so pushed up costs of operating a horse worked wagonway to a level which once again made the collieries on the Middleton Plateau uncompetitive with those much closer to the River Aire. John Blenkinsop who was the overseer (or Manager) of the mines operated by the Middleton Estates on the Plateau was one of the most accomplished and far-sighted colliery engineers of his day. He was aware of the work done by Richard Trevithick to develop a steam locomotive to work on the on the Pen y Darren Tramway in South Wales and knew that the project had failed because the locomotive was too heavy for the crude cast iron rails of the day though it had proved capable of hauling a 50-ton load. He was also aware of the design limitations of the pioneer locomotive which was essentially a single cylinder stationary engine with a large flywheel to keep it turning mounted on rails. Blenkinsop overcame the first of these problems by the ingenious technical fix of decoupling the weight of the locomotive from its ability to pull a worthwhile load by casting a toothed rack into the side of the rails and causing this to engage with a cog wheel driven by the steam engine built into the locomotive ‚Äì as the cog turned in the toothed rack the engine pulled itself along. By this invention he enabled a very light steam locomotive to haul loads of 90 tons or more ‚Äì far more than if it has just relied on its adhesive weight. Blenkinsop's technical fix was essentially what became the rack railway of today. His next action was to find a builder for a steam locomotive incorporating his cog and rack concept. In this he was fortunate that Matthew Murray, probably the most gifted mechanical engineer of his generation, had his factory in Leeds ‚Äì the Round Foundry. Murray had already built two-cylinder stationary engines and realized that he could apply the same idea to Blenkinsop's locomotive thus avoiding the need for a flywheel and the associated complications and ensuring that the locomotive could always restart no matter where it was stopped. The adoption of a multi cylinder design set the precedent for all future successful steam locomotives and was a critical step in the development of commercially and technically successful steam locomotives. The first locomotive to the Blenkinsop-Murray design was built in 1812 and was named 'Salamanca'. It was an immediate success. Three more locomotives to the same basic design, albeit with improvements, were built for the Middleton Railway between 1813 and 1815 and the last was not taken out of service until 1832 which illustrates the fundamental soundness of the design. Other locomotives to the Blenkinsop-Murray design were built for wagonways in South Wales and Lancashire, the first railway locomotives on continental Europe were built to this design and most importantly two locomotives of this design were supplied to the Kenton &amp; Coxlodge Railway in Northumberland where they were studied by George Stephenson. His first locomotive, 'Blucher', was built to this design and his subsequent locomotives including 'Locomotion No. 1' of the Stockton and Darlington Railway were essentially refinements of the Blenkinsop-Murray Design. Other early locomotive designers such as William Hedley of 'Puffing Billy' fame switched from a single cylinder to twin cylinder design after learning of the success of the Blenkinsop-Murray locomotives. The pioneer locomotives designed by Blenkinsop and Murray and built by Murray represented one of the most significant advances in the design of steam locomotives. The Middleton Railway was conceived as a part of the process of extracting coal from the Middleton Plateau and delivering it to the industries and homes of Leeds. Blenkinsop's vision was that there should be no human intervention in this process from the moment the coal was dug from the ground to the moment it was delivered to the customer and in this he anticipated key elements of the Toyota approach to manufacturing by over 150 years. William Strickland visited the Railway from the United States in 1825 and reported on Blenkinsop's work as did the American I innovator and inventor Zachariah Allen who wrote at length about Blenkinsop's mechanized mine transport system. After its pioneering days were over, the Middleton Railway became a 'Terminal Road' serving both the collieries on the Middleton Plateau and other industries in Leeds. George Stephenson on the other hand rapidly saw that railways could form a national transportation network and that this would only be successful if they escaped from the complexities of the cog and rack system and were operated using the adhesive weight of the locomotive alone to haul trains. Accordingly, his first patents were directed at improving the strength of. Rails to overcome the limitation of the cog and rack systems and he subsequently went on to become both one of the world's greatest civil engineers and one of the greatest advocates of rail transportation‚Ä¶ The construction of the pioneering locomotives for the Middleton Railway led to the development of Leeds as a major locomotive building center and more locomotives were built in Leeds than in any other town in England. This industry had a history of innovation and by the very early 1930s was developing diesel locomotives for use on main line as well as industrial railway systems. Leeds locomotive building companies became known throughout the world for the quality of their products as well as their innovative skills. Originally the Middleton Railway was built to four-foot gauge but in order to facilitate connection to the national railway network the gauge of the Railway was converted to standard gauge ‚Äì 4ft 8¬Ω inches ‚Äì in 1881 and a connection was built to the national railway network at Balm Road. Later on, a connection was made to the Great Northern Railway's Beeston Branch which crossed the Railway about 1/2 mile north of Broom Pit ‚Äì the last sunk of the collieries on the Middleton Plateau. In its latter years the Middleton Railway carried coals from the coal mines on the Middleton Plateau to landsale yards at Kidacre Street near the River Aire in Leeds and on Town Street in the village of Middleton as well as to the national railway network and it provided the link between a number of local industries including Clayton Sons &amp; Co. Ltd., who constructed the plant and machinery to produce Town's Gas from coal, Samuel Dennison &amp; Son Ltd., iron founders, John King &amp; Co., Iron founders and lifting equipment manufacturers, the Acme Wagons Works and Messrs Robinson &amp; Birdsell, metal merchants. By the 1950s the Middleton Railway had passed into the ownership of the National Coal Board (NCB). To reduce operating costs, they took the decision to route all coal from the last mine on the Middleton Plateau, Broom Pit, to the national railway network via the connection to the Beeston Branch and close the northern part of the Railway including what had been the first connection to the national railway network at Balm Road. A group of railway enthusiasts drawn largely from the student body at Leeds University and lead by Dr. R. F. (Fred) Youell felt that this historic railway was too important to close and set about trying to save it. Their efforts were rewarded with success when the norther section reopened in June 1960 to carry passengers using a former Swansea and Mumbles Railway railcar hauled by what was the first diesel locomotive to work on the national railway network ‚Äì a 1932 product of the Hunslet Engine Co. of Leeds. The Middleton Railway became once again a pioneer ‚Äì the first standard gauge railway in the world to be preserved and operated by volunteers. After the initial period of passenger carrying the preserved section of the railway resumed its historic role of serving the industries of South Leeds ‚Äì through this time the trains were operated by volunteers, many draw from the ranks of students at the University of Leeds. In 1968 Broom Pit finally closed and the northern and southern sections of the Railway were reunited. Passenger carrying from the Railway's depot at Moor Road, Hunslet, to a platform near the site of Broom Pit started in 1969 and today the passenger service provides the bulk of the Railway/s income. For reasons driven by changes in the attitudes of British Rail, the then operator of the national railway network, to wagon load traffic the Middleton Railway's freight service stopped in 1983. Today the Middleton Railway remains an all-volunteer operated heritage railway keeping alive the remarkable story of the Middleton Railway and its contribution to the development of railways and railway locomotives. KB: What kind of locomotives are on the trains? The Middleton Railway operates on Saturdays and Sundays from start April to end October, on Wednesdays from last week in July to end August and during school half term holidays within the running season and on Bank Holiday Mondays during the running season. The Railway also operates Santa Specials on weekends in December. Historic diesel locomotives built between 1932 and 1968 are used on Saturday and Wednesday trains and historic steam locomotives built between 1890 and 1955 on Sundays, Bank Holiday Mondays and on the Santa Specials. The locomotives are all 4- or 6-wheel locomotives built for shunting (or switching) duties and the majority were built in Leeds. The locomotives are painted in the liveries they would have carried when in commercial service and many are elaborately lined out and feature polished brass and copper work. Colors range from red through multiple shades of green to grey and black with one locomotive waiting repainting in yellow and another in light blue. KB: Where are the trains going to from your station? What are the connections? Trains travel from the station at Moor Road to Park Halt which is near the site of Broom Pit on the edge of the historic Middleton Park in South Leeds. The Park contains ancient woodlands as well as the remains of mediaeval bell pits. Near the Park visitor centre is a replica horse gin ‚Äì the horse powered device used to lower miners into the bell pits and lift them plus coal back to the surface. There is no connection to the national railway system at Moor Road Station though it can be accessed by public transport from the centre of Leeds, and it is easily accessible from Junction 5 of the M621 Motorway ‚Äì use post cos de LS102JQ in the sat nav ‚Äì and has on site car parking KB: How many passengers a year does the station get? Including Santa Specials approx. 19,000 passengers travelled from Moor Road Station in 2019 before the disruption caused by the Covid pandemic. Numbers are building back to these levels. KB: Has the station appeared in movies, series or documentaries? The Middleton Railway has featured in a number of documentaries including 'The Architecture the Railways Built' presented by Tim Dunn and was also the star of 'Fred the Fugitive Engine' ‚Äì a pilot for a Channel 4 Comedy. KB: How many platforms does the station have and how many trains depart and arrive daily? Moor Road Station has just the one platform. When trains are running 8 trains/day depart from the station to travel to Park Halt and there are the same number of trains arriving from Park Halt. Visitors can buy an all-day rover ticket which allows them to ride on as many trains as they wish. KB: Describe for the RSR readers what they would see on a visit to Middleton Railway. Moor Road Station is typical of the kind of passenger station which graced many of Britain's light railways in the 1920s consisting of a paved platform, a timber built open fronted shelter and a palisade fence. Park Halt is even more austere and is typical of the platforms to be found on those industrial railways which carried workers from pit village to the colliery: it consists simply of a platform with no shelter or lights. The approach to Moor Road Station is via 'The Engine House' which is a modern purpose-built structure comprising a ticket office with traditional wainscoting, a caf√©, shop and toilets and a display hall. Visitors walk through the display hall to access the station. The contains a display of those members of Railway's collection of historic steam and diesel locomotives which are not under repair or currently in service with information boards describing their history plus other artefacts. These include the longest surviving section of the original toothed rail which was cast locally in what became Dennison's Foundry, examples of stone sleepers dating back to the launch of steam power on the Railway plus a sectioned locomotive boiler, patterns used to make moulds for casting parts of locomotives such as wheels and cylinders, a foot powered metal working lathe of 1919 and hand powered tools for cutting rails and drilling holes in rails for bolting lengths of rail together. All the engines in display in the Museum have worked on the Railway at some time or another and the majority are like actors 'resting' between engagements. In time the majority will pass through the Railway's workshops to be returned to service whilst the locomotives now working will be allowed to 'rest' for a while. In total about 14 locomotives will be on display with 3 under overhaul and 7 or 8 available for service of which 4 are usually steam locomotives. KB: Why should people travel with Middleton Railway and visit the station? Middleton Railway is one of the most important places in the development of railways and railway locomotives and remarkably has operated every year since opening in 1758. Travelling on the Middleton Railway provides a direct link to the very earliest days of railways and steam locomotives. It should be place of pilgrimage for all bona fide railway enthusiasts. To this day it is a proud independent railway designing and constructing its own coaches, maintaining its locomotives and stock in house and doing all of this with volunteer labour. What the ride may lack in scenic splendor it more than makes up for with its history and whilst its locomotives may be small and lack the glamour of more famous mainline locomotives such as 'Flying Scotsman and 'Mallard' these little engines were the back bone of the manufacturing and extractive industries of three British Isles for more than a century and played a vital, if often unseen, role in the country's history.

9317,"A collection of dishes at Chalong. | Chalong Chalong draws a crowd for standout fare and a fun drink menu It's the season for umbrella cocktails. A fun spot to get one right now is at a Southern Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. Chalong is a standout seafood Thai spot that, in the three or four times I've been, is always packed ‚Äî to the degree that if you're 10 minutes late for a reservation, they'll give your table away. It features a tight menu of inventive dishes, many of which just barely restrain heat. (In short, this is Manhattan Thai, not Elmhurst, but it's still great.) Tight portions won't leave you hungry or too full. Prices are fair, too, in a moment when the average cost of an entree feels high, especially in Manhattan. The place opened in 2023 from Nate Limwong, who grew up on the southern coast of Thailand, who has trained in New York, Thailand, and Australia. The drinks: The illustrated cocktail menu depicts a map of Thailand with drinks sketched around the coastline, with names like After School with pea vodka in a coupe, or the Red Forest with Bombay Sapphire gin and beets. My drink, a Leonardo on the Beach with coconut rum, PX, matcha, pandan, and kinako, is served over pebble ice ‚Äî a refreshing, green tannic drink garnished with a thick layer of coconut shavings, and, of course, there's an umbrella. Cocktails are $18, compared to $20 and up in many places these days. The cocktail list stands in contrast to the lean drink options otherwise: one beer, two whites, two reds ($17 for either by the glass), and one orange ‚Äì by the bottle only. The vibe: This casual spot shows the work of pros behind it: The service is warm but not too chatty. The tunes verge on clubby, but they're not intrusive. And the timing of the dishes is pitch perfect. Chalong Baerng golae at Chalong. Chalong. Crab curry. The food: For a name that means celebrate, the food is appropriately fun. There's baerng golae ($16), a coconut crisp with shrimp and curry for a sweet and savory snack that you eat like a taco. The steamed rice dumplings ($15) present like noodle-wrapped cocoons stuffed with radish and peanuts with a salted coconut aroma. Among the mains, the crab curry offers some heat, a bowl centered with a soft-shell crab in a velvety coconut veloute-like broth ($28). And a wok of green is a welcome contrast, topped with peanuts, and dotted with chiles. Picanha kraw praw ($28) appears a touch boring, with sirloin, habanero, garlic, and holy basil, but it's not just peppers and meat, with layered seasoning and enough heat to warrant another beer. On another visit I was won over by the whole fried fish, pla tod ($36), with a sweet fish sauce, garlic, and scallions. Tips: I'd suggest a starter, a vegetable, and two dishes to share for two. That order plus my cocktail on a recent visit ran about $100 including tax and before tip. Chalong's flavors, service, and price will lure me back again‚Äî next time, for the head-on shrimp fried rice.",NEUTRAL,2

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

10496,"Ernest Hemingway once wrote that ""Paris is a moveable feast."" I think he might have meant ""transportable,"" because a moveable feast changes dates but not location, whereas a transportable feast goes wherever you do. But what do I know?Holidays, like Easter or Passover, that move around the calendar are known as ""moveable feasts."" But I would argue that any occasion that celebrates brunch season  the first sunny Sunday after months of rain, perhaps  is the ultimate moveable feast. And brunch is really just a fancy way of saying, ""I want an alcoholic drink with my breakfast."" (We are not here to judge!) So with that idea in mind, we're offering up the trinity of brunch cocktails  the Bloody Mary, the Mimosa and the Ramos Fizz  all localized and elevated by the addition of one or two new-ish ingredients. It is spring after all, and spring is all about new beginnings and new things. Hemingway also wrote: ""When spring came, even the false spring, there were no problems except where to be happiest."" If that doesn't scream Northern California, I don't know what does. Jeff Burkhart is the author of ""Twenty Years Behind Bars: The Spirited Adventures of a Real Bartender, Vol. I and II,"" the host of the Barfly Podcast on iTunes and an award-winning bartender. Contact him at jeffbarflyIJ@outlook.com A fizz for spring Ingredients 2 ounces Alamere Spirits London Dry Gin 2 ounces unsweetened organic coconut cream (not Coco Lopez)  ¬Ω ounce Cointreau or other good-quality clear triple sec ¬Ω ounce fresh-squeezed Meyer lemon juice 1 whole egg 1 orange zest Fresh grated nutmeg Directions Combine the gin, cream, Cointreau, lemon juice and whole egg in a shaker glass with ice. Shake until foamy. Strain into a chilled coupe glass, being sure to pile up foam on top. Garnish with orange zest and top with grated nutmeg. Note: Eggs are not a new idea (see Golden Fizz) but the richness of the yolk adds a great weight to this fluffy drink. Swapping out the milk cream for coconut cream also adds richness and eliminates any possible curdling, which can happen when combining citrus and milk. Orange flower water (another classic ingredient) is neither very tasty nor readily available. Triple sec, with its high sugar content, not only adds sweetness but also a delicate orangey flavor. A rosy mimosa Ingredients 4 ounces Schug Winery 2019 sparkling ros√© 2 ounces fresh-squeezed tangerine juice ¬º ounce Hanson of Sonoma organic mandarin vodka 1 strip tangerine zest Directions Combine the first three ingredients in a mixing glass and stir once to combine. Allow foam to subside and transfer to a chilled champagne flute. Garnish with zest. By combining ingredients in a separate glass first, you can eliminate the explosive citrus juice foam that happens when you combine sparkling wine with fresh citrus juice. Note: Mimosas are named for the color of mimosa blossoms. Tangerine juice adds a wonderful tartness to this drink, and the mandarin vodka complements that nicely. This version does have a slightly different color, but its tart, fresh flavor more than makes up for the color variation. Umami snapper Ingredients 2 ounces Sausalito Liquor Co. Marin Coastal Gin 3 ounces organic tomato juice 1 dash Worcestershire sauce (about 1/8 teaspoon) 1 dash hoisin sauce 1 dash Sol Food Pique hot sauce 1 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 1 dash good-quality Thai/Vietnamese fish sauce King Floyd's Black Lava salt for rimming Directions Partially rim a pint glass with the black lava salt by wetting the rim with the fleshy side of a piece of citrus and then dabbing the glass into salt before filling with ice. In a separate mixing glass, combine the first seven ingredients and stir. When thoroughly combined pour mixture into rimmed glass. Note: The Red Snapper is a later gin version of the Bloody Mary. The Bloody Caesar is a Bloody Mary made with Clamato juice. This Umami Snapper take combines the best elements of those two: the aromatics of the gin and the umami of the fish sauce (fish sauce doesn't actually taste like fish, just like Clamato doesn't actually taste like clam). The result is a testament to that elusive fifth taste: umami, which is really more of a sensation than a taste.",NEUTRAL,2

Taking place at Piston Distillery's HQ, visitors are treated to a sensory journey surrounded by the sights, sounds and smells of a real working distillery.Welcoming gin enthusiasts and novices alike, the gin experience promises to ignite a passion for spirits and distillation as guests embark on a masterclass to create their own bespoke bottle of gin.On arrival at Piston Distillery HQ, located at Bamfurlong Industrial Park, Staverton, Gin School participants will be surrounded by an array of collectibles, from classic and modern cars, to props and costumes from famous films.A dedicated distiller greets participants with a signature Piston London Dry Gin and Tonic, setting the tone for an afternoon of experimentation. Guests will then head to the Gin School where a room of copper stills and workstations await.Guests are guided through the history and heritage of gin by their distiller, teaching them to master distillation along the way. The experience unfolds through a series of hands-on activities, guided by the experts, in which guests are given all of the building blocks to craft their own unique recipes.With over 75 ingredients to trial, participants can hand-pick and fine tune the botanical flavours that will make up their bespoke bottle of gin.Participants will complete the process by bottling their creations, coining a name for them, and stamping the bottle with a custom Piston Distillery label.The Piston Gin School operates in workshop sizes of twelve to twenty with a cheeseboard for each pair provided.Sessions run on Saturdays from 3pm-6pm, and costs ¬£150 per pair.

As the thought of weekend festivities and libations elevate your mood to stratospheric levels not seen since seven days prior, you start to get into gear for what should be an epic night out. Freshen up. Check. Clean shave. Check. Heck ‚Äì a home made delicately poured gin n tonic has elevated itself into the upper echelons of your pre-party rituals. All is well, barring one glaring omission. The weather is cooler, and you are looking to rock a blazer tonight. But you're not sure if jeans can supersede your standard choice of navy chinos. I mean, you've fully immersed yourself into intense daily workouts so that you eschew the Dad Body stereotypes ‚Äì jumping back in head first with blazers and a pair of jeans wouldn't be the best option. Or could it? Fret not, in this detailed guide, we will cover how to pull off strutting a blazer with jeans, so that you can remain stylistic without looking like you've missed the boat on recent trends and all things fancy schmancy. Why Wear A Blazer With Jeans While a blazer paired with navy or burgundy chinos has long been the attire of choice for those looking to dress business casual, the emergence of well fitted jeans in popular culture has made the latter appear like a much more viable alternative in recent years. The perfect business casual combination (if pulled of correctly), a blazer with jeans ensemble exudes a sense of sophistication, without being overboard. Ideal for an evening out with friends or date night, this particular attire will have you standing out in settings where people are often dressed casually. Courtesy of www.gregsstyleguide.com While it should be a fairly simple exercise, pulling off a blazer / jeans look often proves to be a source of frustration. Done right, and you could almost feel like your floating down the streets ensconced by the latest Putti Umo exhibitions in Italy. Done wrong, however, and well ‚Äì you might just be looking at a horrendously dressed getup reminiscent of the 1980's. You get the point ‚Äì how you select your items and pull off the look is far more important than the notion of the look itself. Hence, in order to pull this off, you need to nail the details. Fabric, texture, fit and cut will all be of critical importance. And for reverend's sake, please avoid opting for a suit jacket with a pair of jeans. Suit jackets are meant for what the name implies ‚Äì suits. Formal suits are typically comprised of worsted wools and are best suited (pun intended) for more serious, stuffy settings. This, combined with the fact that they are typically manufactured with structured / padded shoulders, lends itself to a more formal setting. Courtesy of www.hespokestyle.com Sports Jackets vs Blazers vs Suit Jackets Courtesy of www.dappered.com Blazers, or sports jackets (that we are more commonly referring to in this article) are delineated from suit jackets with regards to the following characteristics: Offered in a wider variety of colors and patterns Are less structured and fitted than a blazer or suit jacket, allowing for a wider range of movement, as well as providing the ability to layer clothing Sometimes feature elbow patches, slits and ticket pockets Compared to a sports jacket, a blazer can be worn across a range of formal settings, with the exception of a full formal setting. The blazer is considered a middle of the road piece (between a suit jacket and a sports jacket), that can significantly enhance the profile of your attire, without having you go overboard. So what are they key factors distinguishing a blazer from a sports jacket. While not worn with jeans, this picture perfectly encapsulates the navy blazer, featuring brass buttons. Courtesy of www.jpressonline.com A blazer is not accompanied by a pattern. Texture within the weave of the fabric is suitable, but there should not be a definitive pattern. Blazers typically have metal buttons, differentiating them from sports jackets ‚Äì and clearly indicating that you are not strutting a suit jacket with off colored pants! Blazers are less structured than suit jackets ‚Äì but are not as soft shouldered / unstructured as a sports jacket. Hence, in summary, a suit (most structured) is the most formal of the three jackets, followed by a blazer, and finally a sports jacket (least structured, or even unstructured). General Rules Of Thumb For Pairing A Blazer w / Jeans Here are some guidelines to generally adhere to when strutting that highly sought after blazer / jeans combination! Strut a high quality blazer that fits well! Slim fit jeans (tapered, but not too skinny!) work best for pairing a blazer in a smart-casual capacity Pairing your jeans with a t-shirt and pair of sneakers will create a stylistic, casual look, while combining them with a buttoned down dress shirt and potentially a pair of loafers will provide for a more formal look. Few combinations are as dapper as a blazer paired with jeans and white sneakers! Courtesy of www.pinterest.com Lighter colored jacket and jeans combinations will create a more casual look, while a darker colored ensemble will lend itself to a more formal aesthetic. Given the more casual nature of sports jackets / blazers, they are best accessorized with a knitted tie and /or textured pocket squares. Avoid the traditional silk tie / pocket square look as much as possible, as it will create a jarring look with the elements clashing. What Type Of Blazer Or Sports Jacket To Go For An unstructured jacket paired with jeans creates the perfect casual getup! Courtesy of www.mensflair.com When opting for a blazer with jeans combination, it is imperative that you go for a jacket with unstructured shoulders that are comfortable and won't impose a sense of formality on you. These will also make you feel like you are wearing something lighter weight and more casual than a blazer (and definitely lighter weight and less formal than a suit jacket). The blazer or sports jacket under consideration should have a certain amount of texture to it, somewhat mirroring the textural weaves apparent in denim. Hence, fabrics such as tweed, corduroy and herringbone can work particularly well, as they are associated with more laid back tailoring and casual wear. Textured jacket fabrics, such as tweed, work extremely well with denim. Courtesy of www.primermagazine.com While Italian Jackets have long been considered appropriate for pairing with jeans, the introduction of quintessential English fabrics, such as tweed, corduroy and herringbone will serve to enhance your blazer / jeans game! Blazer / Sports Jacket Fit The most important element pertaining to jacket fit is centered around the shoulders. The shoulders of the blazer should follow your shoulder lines ‚Äì and your shoulders should therefore not be bulging out of the shoulders, nor should they fall short of the outside seam of the blazer. Courtesy of www.ashleyweston.com The blazer's sleeves should end in the middle of the back of your hand, in between your wrist and your thumb joint. The blazer should also not be too tight, resulting in pulling across the stomach from buttoning the jacket! Blazer / Sports Jacket Colors While blazers are available in a myriad of colors, there are several classic colors that will instantly elevate your look when paired with jeans. Grey, navy, black, tweed and brown blazers are all considered timeless menswear that can be effectively paired with denim for a dapper look! Types Of Jeans That Work Best With Blazers Jeans Color Similar to the requisite blazer profile, the cut and fit of your jeans is of critical importance. Ideally, you want to aim for jeans with a mid rise. These jeans closely resemble traditional dress pants, and hence will work well with a tailored or fitted sports jacket, and will somewhat resemble the fitted aesthetic of a suit. These jeans should sit slightly above your waist, so that a tucked in dress shirt isn't visible below the last sports jacket button. Midrise jeans are imperative when pairing with a blazer! Courtesy of www.pinterest.com Regarding leg width, it is best to stick with a middle ground here, opting for a straight, tapered cut as opposed to jeans that cling to your legs. These jeans should fall cleanly, touching the top of your shoes in a similar vein to suit trousers. What we are effectively going for here are jeans that mimic the silhouette of your suit trousers, which strengthens the impression that you intentionally picked out both items, as opposed to pairing a blazer with any casual pair of jeans, irrespective of the rise or cut of the jeans. Jeans Fit With regards to jeans color, we advocate opting for dark indigo or black denim in order to maintain the formality of the ensemble. Alternatively, you can opt for a pale neutral pair or white denim ‚Äì colors that work particularly well during the spring &amp; summer months. It is, however, imperative that you keep your jackets lighter weight with these combinations, so as to enhance that summer vibe! Please feel free to view The Dark Knot's Knit Ties, which are perfect for pairing with a blazer and jeans! Jeans &amp; Blazer Combinations Pair Dark Jeans With A Grey Blazer Looking to make an impression? Pair your charcoal grey blazer with darker or black colored jeans, and contrast it with a lighter colored dress shirt for maximum effect ‚Äì think a pale blue, light pink or light green shirt. Unbutton the top button for a more relaxed chic aesthetic! Dark Denim pairing perfectly with a grey blazer. Courtesy of www.pinterest.com Embrace The Turtleneck An easy way to eschew the dress shirt and any corresponding difficulties that arise from the incongruence between a blazer and jeans (unless of course you are strutting a knitted tie, more on that below) ‚Äì is to embrace midlayers, such as a polo shirt or turtleneck. The latter works especially well during the fall &amp; winter months, lending to a seamless look, with the turtleneck providing the perfect bridge between your pair of jeans and blazer / sports jacket! A turtleneck provides for a seamless, integrated look featuring a blazer and a pair of jeans! Courtesy of www.pinterest.com Blue &amp; Brown When it comes to pairing jeans with a blazer, it is often easier to stick to tried and tested color combinations that work, such as the classic brown and navy pairing. Opt for the evergreen textured brown blazer, such as a brown tweed jacket with blue jeans pairing. Heck, you could throw in a turtle grey neck for added effect. Tried &amp; tested, and it always works! Courtesy of www.pinterest.com Seamless Monochromatic Seeking out that all elusive monochromatic look? A pair of black jeans with a darker colored blazer and a black turtleneck (gasp!) will have you looking the part and then some. A monochromatic blazer with jeans combination is perfect for an evening out, whether its at a chic restaurant or classic cocktail bar! That seamless monochromatic look, contrasted perfectly with sneakers! Courtesy of www.lookastic.com Contrast Lighter Colored Jeans with a Darker Blazer In stark contrast to the above combinations (pun intended), pair your blazer with pale or white denim for that ultimate summer look. Bring the whole ensemble together with a lighter colored dress shirt, and a knit to or textured (ideally linen or cotton) pocket square for added effect! While a tee could be worn, we highly recommend eschewing the casual t-shirt attire and instead opting for a dress shirt, creating a far more polished look. That perfect summer look, with a madras cotton tie! Courtesy of www.hespokestyle.com Casual Blazer With Lighter Colored Jeans An unstructured, even lighter weight summer blazer such as a linen jacket can pair effectively with a pair of white denim or medium blue jeans. Complement the look with a knitted polo and a pair of loafers! An unstructured jacket with white jeans results in the perfect summer look! Courtesy of www.lookastic.com Brass Button Blazer with Jeans Seeking out that sought after preppy look? Pair a traditional navy blazer with brass buttons with your dark denim, and a regimental striped silk tie for that ultimate collegiate look! A white linen or pocket square with a presidential square fold will go a long way towards enhancing your look! A classic brass buttoned navy blazer paired with jeans provides for an elegant look! Courtesy of www.alittlebitofrest.com Accessorizing Your Blazer &amp; Jeans Combination As mentioned above, styling your blazer and jeans combination can involve some of the following to really pack a punch and accentuate that aesthetic! Non traditional, non silk ties. While there is a place for silk ties, such as the regimental striped silk with the preppy blazer look, we generally advocate ditching the conventional tie for a neckpiece with more character and texture. Examples include novelty polyester ties, often accompanied by a recreational / leisure theme, floral cotton ties (ideal for pairing with your lighter weight, unstructured blazers during the spring / summer months), and our personal favorite ‚Äì knit ties. A navy blazer &amp; white jeans combination is immaculately complemented by a stunning knitted tie here! Courtesy of www.menswearmusings.com A Knitted Tie, as its name implies, is a tie that has been knitted rather than woven. Knitted ties are characterized by an open weave, a narrow blade and square ends (versus triangular, pointed ends that you typically see with a jacquard woven or printed silk ties) ‚Äì it is these very characteristics that make knitted ties an ideal complement to business casual attire such as a blazer styled with jeans! Additionally, knitted ties are generally slimmer in width, making them the perfect complement for a more casual ensemble. Textured Pocket Squares are the perfect way to spruce up an ensemble featuring a blazer. While pocket squares in general work extremely well with any blazer combination, a unique pairing of a blazer with jeans demands something with more texture i.e ‚Äì a linen or cotton pocket square! A navy sports jacket with jeans is exquisitely complemented by this cotton pocket square. Courtesy of www.lookastic.com Linen or Cotton pocket squares provide the perfect textural complement to your whole ensemble. When choosing a pocket square, try going for a color that complements your tie, but doesn't exactly match it. For example, a blue pocket square would complement a burgundy knitted tie. Additionally, the pattern spacing of the pocket square should be different to that of the tie (assuming that the tie is patterned). Hence, a larger spaced polka dot or paisley pocket square will complement a striped knitted tie, for example. ÔªøPlease feel free to view The Dark Knot's Pocket Squares, which are perfect for elevating your style game with a blazer and jeans! Shoes Pairings With A Blazer &amp; Jeans Your range of shoe options when pairing a blazer with jeans are fairly wide. A great pair of suede or leather loafers, oxford dress shoes or chukka boots would ideally complement your blazer / denim attire. Suede loafers add visual depth and texture, providing for a more nuanced aesthetic. Additionally, leather loafers can work extremely well. Suede shoes pulled off to great effect with this blazer &amp; jeans combination! Courtesy of www.chiesipharma.com While we would typically advocate for loafers or chukkas with a more 'formal' blazer with jeans combination, and sneakers with a more casual blazer with jeans ensemble, we do think that context matters ‚Äì especially in light of sneakers becoming more commonplace over the last several years. Darker toned jeans and blazers can still maintain an aura of formality with monochromatic white sneakers. Who said a more formal blazer look can't be strutted with white sneakers. Courtesy of www.pinterest.com So while we would usually suggest opting for those loafers the next time you strut your dark denim with a blazer, we do think that there is ample room for your sneaker game, should you choose to incorporate it! Alternatively, leather boots can work in a more casual capacity, such as a blazer paired with a t-shirt. Hence, there aren't any necessarily hard &amp; fast rules to follow ‚Äì as with most things style. Leather boots with a more casual blazer &amp; jeans ensemble.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

You can also make a gin by infusing vodka with spices and herbs for a few weeks.Whiskey comes from corn or grains and tastes a lot like vodka which also comes from grains or potatoes, until it's aged in flamed barrels and picks up wood notes (vanilla, smoke, etc) that make it different.",NEUTRAL,2

12108,"Track 4 from his debut solo album released in 1975 copyright Nemperor Records. It was recorded at the Record Plant in L.A., Electric Lady Studios in NYC and Trident Studios in London. Tommy Bolin was born and raised in Sioux City, Iowa and began playing in bands at the age of thirteen. He moved to Boulder, Colorado in his late teens and joined a band called Zephyr, which featured a dynamic female singer. He went on to do a lot of session work and became Joe Walsh's replacement in James Gang for two albums in '73 &amp; '74. He also featured on a couple of jazz fusion albums, which was a genre he was passionate about. This album featured an impressive list of guest musicians including David Foster, drummer Jeff Porcaro, RIP and sax master David Sanborn, RIP. After his performance on Billy Cobham's fusion album ""Spectrum"" his fellow musicians recognized his talent and were eager to work with him to help him achieve his goals. When Tommy questioned his own vocal abilities he received advice and encouragement from none other than the Beach Boys, who gave him the confidence that he could pull it off. The album received enthusiastic reviews from critics and was praised for its use of reggae, Latin and jazz influences. Bolin had continued writing songs with his old friends Jeff Cook and John Tesar, who helped co-write half the album and all the songs are great. During the recording sessions, Bolin was contacted by David Coverdale who asked him if he'd like to join Deep Purple as Ritchie Blackmore's replacement. Blackmore had left Deep Purple after the ""Stormbringer"" album released the year before. Bolin accepted and soon after met the other members at Musicland Studios in Munich, Germany to begin recording their next album ""Come Taste the Band."" He was excited by the opportunity and looked forward to making enough money to allow him to further his solo career. However, his commitment to Deep Purple took away his ability to promote ""Teaser"" with any kind of tour and he missed out on the exposure he would have gained from live performances. Deep Purple agreed to perform his songs ""Homeward Strut"" and ""Wild Dogs"" on their tour to help promote the album. Van Halen were known to perform ""The Grind"" in their early club days and Motley Crue covered ""Teaser"" for a charity album. Despite its stellar cast of musicians and great reviews, the album only reached No. 96 on the Billboard chart. Written by Tommy Bolin &amp; Jeff Cook and produced by Tommy Bolin &amp; Lee Kiefer. RIP Tommy Bolin, Jeff Porcaro &amp; David Sanborn. Featuring:Tommy Bolin - Lead vocals, lead &amp; rhythm guitarsSpecial Guests:Glenn Hughes - Co-Lead vocal on ""Dreamer""David Foster - Piano &amp; synthesizer on ""The Grind,"" ""Homeward Strut"" &amp; ""Dreamer""Jan Hammer - Synthesizer on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder,"" drums on ""People, People""Ron Fransen - Piano on ""Lotus""David Sanborn - Sax on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Stanley Sheldon - BassPaul Stallworth - Bass on ""Savannah Woman,"" Wild Dogs"" &amp; ""Lotus""Phil Collins - Percussion on ""Savannah Woman""Sammy Figeuroa - Percussion on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Rafael Cruz - Percussion on ""People, People"" &amp; ""Marching Powder""Jeff Porcaro - Drums on ""The Grind,"" ""Homeward Strut,"" ""Dreamer"" &amp; ""Teaser""Prairie Prince - Drums on ""Savannah Woman"" &amp; ""Wild Dogs""Michael Walden - Drums on ""Marching Powder""Bobby Berge - Drums on ""Lotus""Dave Brown - Background vocals on ""The Grind""Lee Kiefer - Background vocals on ""The Grind""Savannah woman dressed in whiteStands out in tropical rainsShe pulls her gin and tonics tightAnd curses her lonely domainBrazilian winds blow warm in RioA white estate they call 'The Nada'Meant for her soul or so she saidHides her sadist, gin-made eyesNo one knows but me how she left me so behindSavannah woman, I could never leave you so unkindSnow white and with desireThat vamp from the magazineCold and distant as the moonWhy can't she burn like fire?No one knows but me how she left me so behindSavannah woman, I could never leave you so unkind",NEUTRAL,2

12579,"Aplocheilus dayi phenotype (a) male and (b) female, Aplocheilus werneri phenotype (c) male and (d) female, Aplocheilus parvus (e) male and (f) female. in Sudasinghe, Ranasinghe, Wijesooriya, R√ºber et Meegaskumbura, 2024. DOI: 10.1111/jfb.15792 facebook.com/HiranyaSud Researchgate.net/publication/380732853 Abstract Three nominal species of the killifish genus Aplocheilus are reported from the lowlands of Sri Lanka. Two of these, Aplocheilus dayi and Aplocheilus werneri, are considered endemic to the island, whereas Aplocheilus parvus is reported from both Sri Lanka and Peninsular India. Here, based on a collection from 28 locations in Sri Lanka, also including a dataset of Asian Aplocheilus downloaded from GenBank, we present a phylogeny constructed from the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1), and nuclear recombination activating protein 1 (rag1), and investigate the interrelationships of the species of Aplocheilus in Sri Lanka. The endemic Sri Lankan aplocheilid clade comprising A. dayi and A. werneri is recovered as the sister group to the clade comprising A. parvus from Sri Lanka and Aplocheilus blockii from Peninsular India. The reciprocal monophyly of A. dayi and A. werneri is not supported in our molecular phylogeny. A. dayi and A. werneri display strong sexual dimorphism, but species-level differences are subtle, explained mostly by pigmentation patterns. Their phenotypes exhibit a parapatric distribution and may represent locally adapted forms of a single species. Alternatively, the present study does not rule out the possibility that A. dayi and A. werneri may represent an incipient species pair or that they have undergone introgression or hybridization in their contact zones. We provide evidence that the Nilwala-Gin region of southwestern Sri Lanka may have acted as a drought refugium for these fishes.

Then I would take a walk ( luckily we have some acreage)  with may tiny dog. As dusk approached, I would sit on a rock and just watch the sky. I would listen to the wind in the trees. Also, I'd watch the birds as they flew into the sheltering trees/brush for the night.  The sky would get darker, but I knew the land just like my house, so wasn't worried about the dark. I would just think about my life, our life together, the huge universe. Sometimes I would start crying, other times I would fee such peace and gratitude. My little dog, about 6 lbs, would sniff around fro squirrels, or mice, whatever. Just the peace of the forest would be so comforting. It was fall, and the moon would come up, it was near the full moon, and everything was so beautiful. My goddess is Mother Nature. My church is the outdoors. Had I never met my spouse ‚ù§Ô∏è,  I don't think I would have the same relationship with nature as I do now.

Vodka martini, no vermouth, with a twist.If they just said Martini, no other explanation, I would do the standard, which gin, and vermouth, with olive garnish.

14170,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

It's subtle and perfectly unisex. Slightly feminine on the opening to some but I think it's easily pulled off by a well dressed man. Montagne perfumes has a fantastic quality clone of itFor a bitter aromatic woody one, try Ormonde Jayne Man. Piney and very bright on the uplifting spices. It's so damn classy and not citrusy though can be the slightest bit soapy on the far dry down. I hate soapy and this doesn't go deep enough to put me off.No clones for it though. But classy and so goodThe final and possibly my favourite is Chanel Edimbourg. No clones again but really reasonable price (¬£75 for a 75ml).

I've been in Nashville for 13 years, but the last two and a half, three years, I'm kind of losing track of time. It has been nonstop. It has been like one blessing after another. It seems like the stars will align and then you think, 'All right, well, that might be it.' And somehow the stars align again. It's a journey and it's a great one."" ++SEPARATED BY BLACK FRAMES++SOUNDBITE (English) Lainey Wilson, recording artist ""It is hard because, I mean, you at times, you know, you say yes to a lot of things and then a little time goes down the road and you're like, 'Man, you know, I'm tired.' You know, you're trying to keep up. But I have to be very intentional about it. I have to be, like, put on my calendar, 'BLOCK, NO EXCEPTIONS.' You know, I have to do that for myself because if I'm not finding the time to be grounded and get centered and and remember why I'm doing all of this and staying connected to that, then I can see where you get lost along the way because it's ninety to nothing."" ++SEPARATED BY BLACK FRAMES++SOUNDBITE (English) Lainey Wilson, recording artist ""I think there's a lot of work that still needs to be done. I do think it's getting better. And to even say that is a dang shame, you know what I'm saying? But at the end of the day, when I think about like me being in the position that I am here is because of what the women before me have done. It's because of folks like Reba and Dolly and Wynona and Shania Twain and Faith Hill, and then you got Miranda and Carrie doing it for folks like me. And I got to make sure that I'm doing that for other people. I think it's about just going back down those those roads and chopping down the weeds. And we're just gonna have to continue doing that to to see a huge difference. There's a little difference, but we wait on that big one.""++SEPARATED BY BLACK FRAMES++SOUNDBITE (English) Hardy, recording artist ""Jimmy Iovine called my manager and said, 'Hey, man, Snoop and Dre want to do. Want Hardy to do a cover of 'Gin and Juice' to help promote their their seltzer.' And he told me that. And I was like, 'What?' And he was like, 'Bro, I swear to God.' I was like, 'Are you kidding me?' And the next thing I knew, man, like, I'm on a Zoom call with Snoop and Dre and Jimmy Iovine, and we're talking about, like, creative directions. And I'm just like, 'What is going on?' But it all worked out, man. We recorded it, and then we went and shot the video out in L.A., and Snoop and Dre came and obviously was in the video. Snoop called me his nephew, Dude, I was like, 'Let's go. I got an Uncle Snoop for life.' It was awesome. It was so cool, man.""++SEPARATED BY BLACK FRAMES++SOUNDBITE (English) Hardy, recording artist ""I announced my album tonight, which is not a country album. It's my first full length rock and roll album and it's called 'QUIT!!' and It's fricking dope. And I got Fred Durst on it from Limp Bizkit and Chad Smith from Red Hot Chili Peppers and a kid named Knox, who I'm really stoked about. It's 13 songs and I'm just so, so, so proud of it.

Instead I think it's better to think in terms of distillation method. Pot-still rum is funky and powerful, whereas column-still rum is dry and light. Age is less important. I picked Plantation 3 Star and Appleton Signature for giving two excellent flavor profiles. Neither of them are overly extreme but 3 Star is a good blended rum with just enough character to be interesting while Appleton is a funkier profile but still very drinkable. Both are extremely affordable.Also, Monkey Shoulder is technically a blended malt scotch whiskey, which is kind of unusual.

15340,"MOTIVATION!!!! Motivation is often the biggest challenge for people wanting to get fitter and healthier. A couple of the most common questions people ask me are ""how can I get motivated?"" and ""how do you stay motivated all year round?""The truth is, there are lots of days when I struggle with motivation too. I have days where I can't be bothered to do anything and want to lay on a sofa eating ice cream all day. What I do have though is discipline, and I make small daily lifestyle choices that, after a while, form good habits. Most importantly, I constantly remind myself WHY I exercise.I'm 39 years old this September and I'm the fittest and healthiest I've ever been. My motivation to exercise isn't to be lean, that's just a side effect of my lifestyle choices. What truly motivates me to exercise is my mental health. I exercise to feel good. I want to feel happy and energised, have patience with my kids, and feel driven and inspired to work hard everyday. This all comes from 3 things: sleep, movement and nutrition.It can feel quite scary and complicated or confusing, but really it's just about making small daily choices and being consistent. I still enjoy a chocolate bar and a gin &amp; tonic, but I stay active everyday and I mainly cook healthy food at home.So my main message today is: try to shift your mindset from being just about body weight, fat loss or body image and focus on your mental health. When you do that, you'll realise what exercise and healthy food really is about. Then when you live that lifestyle for long enough, you will become stronger, leaner, fitter, healthier and happier.And when you do have one of those days when you are struggling for motivation, always remind yourself that you will never regret a workout and always feel better afterwards.Have a great week,Love Joe x",NEUTRAL,2

Uhm, so because some of his symptoms overlap with those of Covid, we will do a swab on him and you should hear back in about 24 to 48 hours with those results and he should isolate for 14 days because of those symptoms. And it doesn't, it sounds more in keeping with the picture of community acquired pneumonia, so for that we will get a chest x-ray, we'll check his oxygen and his temperature and if the chest x-ray shows consolidation umm, or some sort of infiltrate, it is likely that he has pneumonia. So, we will start by giving him some amoxicillin populate or cefuroxime for five days, and just keep monitoring his symptoms. They should resolve in about 5 days when the course of antibiotics is complete. If his condition gets worse like he's getting neurological deficits like weakness or seizures, just take him to the ER. And if symptoms don't resolve in five to seven days, we can do further work up or things like fungal infections or TB, or things like that. How does that sound?",DOCTOR,1

Um and to diagnose these things, usually it's just done by history and physical exam um but if after we try out some management things, it doesn't go away or you're having some red flags, including um numbness in the groin area, bowel or bladder incontinence, then we can look at some um imaging for the for the spine, including MRI.

16768,"WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOUR CHURCH IS BETTER THAN OTHERS?-    Bishop David OyedepoThere are days and there are certain days. May today be to every worshiper a certain day, a day to be remembered. A day you will not forget in a hurry. Such days are days of encounter with light. It is not easy to miss out on a day of light. You may forget a day of miracles but a day of light is not easy to forget. Nothing endures like a genuine encounter with light. They are not easily forgotten. ""There is a place for you on top if you are interested"", it lives with me not that I think He said it. I know my response and the effect are here. -    May today be that day when your light will strike you and lead to testimonies for years to come. It is not enough to teach what way to go, it is important to let people know why it is not working. The ultimate of every truth we enquire about is to make it work. People are looking for what is wrong with somebody else, nobody's unbelief can make your faith have no effect.. Nobody's unbelief under heaven can make your faith have no effect. Where I am and where you are in your responsibility and your choice. -    In the name of Jesus today must be one day you will remember for years to come. Heavenly Father, we are here at the feet of Jesus. Let your word come true to every one of us. Let your word come alive today in Jesus precious name. Please take note of the following before we get into our teaching series today. -    We are in the eleventh hour of Operation Change of Story. The eleventh hour is everybody's opportunity in case there was any form of slumber in the first to sixth weeks. Now we are in the seventh week, the last of the weeks please connect. Only those who truly believe in a messenger can be impacted by his message. They never believed in the message of Jesus even though he came straight from God. Human beings have their choice. Only those who truly believe in a messenger can be impacted by their message. Until you receive the prophet what he carries cannot impact your life. Why are you sweating? For you. I have not faked one thing or tried to impress you with one kind of statement. It is working for me 101% and consistently so. Only those who truly receive a messenger can be impacted by his message. Jesus landed in Nazareth, people said ""Is this not Jesus, the man that ran away. He is to take over from his father as a carpenter. They just said he went somewhere and was preaching, who taught him how to preach.  they don't preach in their family"". They did not receive his person, they could not be impacted by his message. A word is enough for the wise. I received the message and the person of Hagin and his cloak fell on me. I received the person and message of Copeland and I received the person and message of E.A. Adeboye. There is no doubt where the things that are working in my life are coming from. Please wake up.. Paul was weeping in warning the Church against vulgar tongues, deadly tongues. That is why things are not working for many. Anything done or said against the Church is against Jesus. Acts 9:5. Not your church only, any Church of Christ. Anything that you and your wife sit down to talk against the Church of Christ is deadly. It is poisonous. It is a killer disease. Many have killed themselves without knowing.. I have told you by teaching and by example, you have never heard me speak against a Church in your life so where did you get it from? You say our Church is better than yours, which Church is your own. Jesus bought the Church with His blood. Caution. You may not agree against the doctrine of a church but anything you do against the Church of Christ in secret or in open you pay. Acts 20:29-31, 1 Thessalonians 4:11. You gather against the leadership of your unit, what is your problem? Did they force you to be there? Leaders of units gather against the Pastor. People are killing themselves without knowing where their death sentence is coming from. 2 Thessalonians 1:6. That is God's agenda for the troublers of His Church ‚Äì tribulation. Troubles without numbers. Beware! I have seen disciples from other Churches coming to me and telling me what their leader said and I just despise and throw it away. I know where I am going. If they talk against you, face your business you don't understand them. Church Gist. Don't be dragged into deadly talks. James 3:5. When people get saved on the field, I tell them to ensure they belong to a living Church, ours is only one of several thousand. That's the truth. Caution! It is not just about me in this Church, anywhere you are in your life. If you speak against the Church of Christ the price is heavy. Matthew 12:30-32. When the Holy Ghost is moving, don't sit down somewhere and be mocking it. It shall not be forgiven. Paul did the things he did in ignorance but he suffered. The way he was bounding people, that is the way they bound him, everything he did, he paid. I told one of my mentors that you don't need to be beaten to write an epistle, I have not been beaten but I write epistles. He was beating believers, he had to get the beating back. You better wake up. Thank God for principles but thank God much more for corrections in scriptures.. So you don't labour in vain. You will never miss your place. This is God Himself just reacting, may God never react against anyone of us in the name of Jesus Christ. Every truth of scriptures we believe is for our triumph, it is for our benefit. I said humorously that the truth we don't believe is for our own cup of tea.  Romans 6:23, 14:23. The truth you despise is your cup of coffee. You will just lose value. 1 Samuel 2:30. The truth you scorn is your cup of gin. I pray that the triumph God has ordained for His children, you will not miss your portion. May no one go for blasphemy against the Holy Ghost anymore in his life. When you find a warning like this, it may be the last warning. Caution! Caution!! Some leaders of ministries gathered at a time and were planning how to disrupt this Church, none of them today has any place of meaning in ministry. Isaiah 54:15. Don't gather against the move of God, it is a risk. Don't work against it. Don't de-evangelize people from one church to your church. We had a church next to us in Raji Oba, 1A New Era Road. It was a CPM Church, there was no issue. A dwarf fence separated us, the pastor came to us to teach him about Church Growth, we did. Our Church was growing, the other one was growing. Nobody was going there and we said: ""No! Come here. This one is better"".  That's why we are where we are.#BishopDavidOyedepo#HeavenlyMandate",NEUTRAL,2

16956,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer."" He has previously been spotted vacationing at Candlewood Lake.",NEUTRAL,2

This shrub has not lasted for long in the fridge though as it is so delicious and refreshing with bubbly water or with gin or champagne. The shrub syrup is also amazing when poured over fresh strawberries. A shrub is an old fashioned recipe for a drinking vinegar that can be made using fruit or vegetables, spices and herbs, sugar and vinegar and historically sometimes alcohol such as rum. Shrubs are a creative way of preserving and intensifying seasonal flavours and are fantastic in cocktails and with any kind of bubbles as a refreshing drink. The traditional ratio for making shrub is 1:1:1, fruit or vegetable, sugar, vinegar. I have made my own twist on the old fashioned shrub by decreasing the sugar and the vinegar to work with the sweetness of blood oranges and spices that intensify this sweetness such as cinnamon and vanilla and the addition of a small amount of orange blossom honey for added ‚Ä¶Ingredients:Produce:500 g Blood oranges1 Small knob Ginger1 tsp Pink pepper corns3 sprigs Thyme, freshCondiments:2 tsp HoneyBaking &amp; Spices:1 Cinnamon stick200 g Coconut sugar1/2 tsp Nutmeg, ground3 Star aniseOils &amp; Vinegars:1/2 cup Apple cider vinegarNuts &amp; Seeds:1 Vanilla pod with seeds scrapedLiquids:1/2 cup WaterOther:1 2 500ml glass jars or bottles",NEUTRAL,2

20197,"In a tiny state overflowing with nearly 30 different craft breweries, beer-makers get plenty of buzz.  But if you're looking for a real buzz - and one that packs a punch stronger than any brew - Delaware's six spirit-makers have you covered.  And since May 22 is National Distillery Day, you have an excuse to try a First State vodka, bourbon, rum or gin on a Wednesday without raising too many eyebrows, even though it is also officially ""hump day.""  Five of Delaware's homespun distilleries have tasting rooms, allowing you to swing by and either buy a bottle of craft spirits or take a seat for a pour or a homemade cocktail.Bear-based Diamante Distillers, opened in 2019, is the lone Delaware distillery without a tasting room, but officials there say they are planning to open one next year. Diamante produces only one brand, Blu Steel Vodka, which is also available in lemon, vanilla, orange and grapefruit flavors. You can find it on liquor shelves not only across Delaware, but also in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington, D.C.If you're looking for a spot where you can pull up a chair and sample the hard stuff, these are your five options in the state.Dogfish Head Distilling320 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach, and 6 Cannery Village Center, MiltonDelaware's biggest craft brewery also has the largest distilling operation, offering nearly 30 different ""off-centered"" bottles, along with an array of canned cocktails. Spirits include rum, gin, vodka, whiskey and more, including a pumpkin liqueur. Their Prohibition-inspired bottle of Sonic Archeology, which blends Dogfish Head whiskey, rum and apple brandy with honey along with lemon and pomegranate juices, is among the most unique. In terms of the on-the-go canned cocktails Dogfish has added in recent years, they offer everything from tequila margaritas, rum Mai Tais and vodka mules to vodka lemonades, vodka crushes and a gin crush.Painted Stave Distilling106 W. Commerce St., SmyrnaSince 2013, Painted Stave has been producing bottles of vodka, whiskey, gin and liqueurs in the heart of Smyrna using local ingredients. (That's why they don't make rum -  no sugar cane is produced in the First State.) One of their most fun releases has been their Off the Hoof scrapple-flavored vodka, complete with a cartoon tattooed pink pig on the label. At their tasting room and cocktail garden, try the Pig Pen Martini made with Off the Hoof vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and olives.Beach Time Distilling32191 Nassau Road, near LewesEntering its 10th season next year, Beach Time is a small distillery run by owner Greg Christmas  just off Del. 1, about four miles west of downtown Lewes. You can find him or his staff slinging drinks at the small beach-themed tasting room with 10 cocktails to choose from, including the Volcano (Beach Nut Toasted Coconut Rum, pineapple juice, pink guava nectar and muddled lime), the Fire Storm (Beach Fire Spiced Rum and ginger beer) and the Juiceman Sour (Juiceman White Whiskey and simple syrup). Spirits available in bottles include six rum varieties, gin, vodka and bourbon.easySpeak Spirits586 Milford Harrington Highway, MilfordFourteen cocktails and 19 different bottled spirits are produced at Milford easySpeak, which also offers a full food menu of bar bites, quesadillas, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and seven different macaroni and cheese varieties including eye-poppers such as filet mignon, shrimp or lobster. Try the Creamsicle Float made with orange vodka, fresh orange juice, vanilla and milk, topped with bubbles and maybe bring home a bottle of black cherry rum.Feebs Distilling Co.733 McColley St., MilfordOwned by Eric and Stacey and Eric Fibelkorn, Feebs grew out of Eric's hobby of making moonshine at home. Now they offer sweet homemade flavored brandies (apple, blueberry, blackberry, peach and strawberry) at their distillery, along with aged whiskey bourbon and ""Unaged Korn Whiskey,"" his original ""white lighting"" moonshine recipe. In their tasting room, they sell seven varieties of their popular alcoholic slushies: ""Hillbilly Lemonade,"" peach/mango, strawberry/watermelon, ""Apple Pie,"" ""Feebs-a Rita,"" blueberry punch and Old Fashioned.Have a story idea?

20412,"Originally Published Jun. 26, 2020. With the start of summer comes seasonal drinks for kickbacks with friends and family while enjoying the weather. It is a time where you can enjoy your favorite summer drink either by yourself or with a companion. As you prepare your bar with your favorite wine and spirits, add a few Black-owned brands to your top shelf. For Outdoor Dining And Picnic ‚Äî¬†Le F√™te Du Ros√© As the first Black-owned ros√© based out of St. Tropez, France, founder and CEO, Donae Burston wanted to created a wine that had a more multicultural focus in its marketing materials. The fruity, eco-friendly ros√© wine is ideal for outdoor outings like picnics with friends on a beautiful day. For People Dreaming Of Their Next Vacation ‚Äî Cremas Absalon¬† Cremas is a Haitian rum similar to coquito in Puerto Rico. Cremas Absalon brings the traditional drink to a larger audience with a twist: a cream liqueur with a taste that reminds you of an island vacation. The company also produces an ice cream made from the rum to enjoy during the summer. For Drinks After Dark With Friends ‚Äî HH Bespoke Spirits Gin is another popular spirit that shows a lack of diversity in its field. The owners behind HH Bespoke Spirits used the inspiration of the Harlem Renaissance to bring their traditional London Dry style gin to a modern American audience. For Someone Who Enjoys A Solo Drink ‚Äî Uncle Nearest Uncle Nearest is named after the country's first Black master distiller, Nathan ""Nearest"" Green, who was believed to perfect the Lincoln Country Process that created Tennessee Whiskey. He is also the one who taught Jack Daniels how to distill his whiskey. The brand opened in 2019 in Tennessee to honor the African American whiskey maker.

20444,"On Mother's Day in 1964, La Ginestra restaurant opened its doors. It's been owned and operated by the same family in the same location on Throckmorton Avenue in downtown Mill Valley for 60 years. Salvatore and Maria Aversa christened their new restaurant La Ginestra, Italian for ""scotch broom,"" which blooms robustly over the hills of Marin and reminded them of the home they had left in Italy with the same yellow-coated hills.Many young people who grew up in Mill Valley remember La Ginestra as one of the first places they dined out with their families. Parents were made to feel welcome with their toddlers. Some of those same children have returned to repeat the experience with their own kids. My friend and I parked in the lot to the right of the restaurant and walked into the bar area. There is also an entrance directly into the restaurant from the street. The bar stools were mostly full and a couple of the tables were, too. Laura and I are both fans of Negronis ($15). We were in an Italian bar, so it seemed only appropriate for us to both order one. They were the classic style of one-third each of Campari, gin and sweet vermouth. Their slightly bitter flavors work well before or after dinner. Food can be ordered in the bar area, too. The bar area offers a comfortable space where those seated at the bar join in conversation and become acquaintances. After finishing our drinks, we walked on through to the dining area and were seated at a booth toward the back, across from the kitchen area. I like sitting near the kitchen to check out the action. Menu specials were tucked inside the main menu. As a neighborhood place, it's wise of them to offer specials to keep the locals interested. Pinsa ($19) was listed as an appetizer. Pinsas, Roman-style pizzas, are showing up on many menus around the Bay Area. Their lighter, crispier style is intriguing. La Ginestra's interpretation of the pinsa was different from others I've tasted  with no complaints from me. It was more like a dense, crispy flatbread. The oval crust was topped with artichoke puree, thinly sliced, house-made porchetta, a slow-cooked herb and garlic seasoned pork, and smoked mozzarella. The oval was cut into eight portions, each topped with a generous dollop of crescenza cheese. A bit of chopped fresh basil gave the finishing touch. The full-flavored Orecchiette Pugliese ($22)  tossed with broccoli rabe, house-made Italian-style sausage and pecorino cheese  competed with several pastas on the menu, including a daily special ($24). We chose the Orecchiette since it stood out from some of the more familiar pastas, such as the Carbonara ($22), Spaghetti Bolognese ($22) and Spaghetti Vongole ($23). No doubt they would have been equally delicious. The pasta is the vehicle that delivers the sauce. The kitchen has a controlled approach to the sauces, so they share equal prominence with the pasta. And the pasta portion made it humanly possible to enjoy. Gluten-free pasta is available for some of the pasta dishes. La Ginestra offers an extensive and interesting wine list concentrating on Italian wines and listed by region or area, such as Sardinia, Campania and Sud Italia. Wines by the bottle run from $60 to $250. Several wines are offered by the glass, such as Verdicchio ($16 a glass, $59 a bottle) and Barbaresco ($22 a glass, $80 a bottle). Veal is something not offered on many menus these days. I asked our waiter where they sourced their veal. He said, ""Let me ask my dad."" His dad was Tino Alversa, the restaurant's manager. After so many years of badly, cruelly raised veal, asking is a must. He said it was ""raised free-range."" Tino Alversa and his siblings, Lucia and Fabio, have spent years developing a good relationship with their food suppliers. Many of the floor staff are family or practically so, like Tim, who has worked there for 30 years. Laura ordered the Vitello Piccata ($29). Lightly floured and saut√©ed thin pieces of veal were in a pan sauce of white wine and capers, lightly mounted with butter. I was expecting more lemon tang in the sauce. Roasted potatoes in their jackets and a bundle of dark green, tender chard filled out the plate. All were tasty but not as flavorful as the pinsa or the pasta. The potatoes and chard also accompanied the Scampi ($29). Six medium-large prawns were cooked in butter and olive oil and served with an Italian-style green sauce. It only takes a moment to overcook prawns and those prawns, unfortunately, were tough. There wasn't much green sauce to cuddle the flavorless prawns. The Pollo Milanese ($26) and the Pollo Marsala ($26) both read well on the menu. Next time I'll order one of those or the fish of the day. Also, I want to order a pizza. I remember delicious La Ginestra pizzas from a time when not every other eating establishment had them on the menu. All desserts are made in house, like the Cheesecake ($10), Cannoli ($8) and Tiramisu ($10). We chose the Tiramisu, the recipe of the late matriarch of the family, Maria Aversa, which she was making up until recently. Now her daughter, Lucia, and son, Tino, have adapted it for current tastes. Limoncello-scented and dusted with dark cocoa, the whipped mascarpone cream and ladyfinger dessert was a manageable size. You'll enjoy it without regretting the richness. This family-owned and -operated Italian restaurant has been serving the community for the past 60 years. The service provided by the family has stayed true to their goal of providing well-prepared and warmly served food in a comfortable environment for dinner or to celebrate a special occasion.

21126,"Old man Yama's fit is kinda basic but he's the head captain so it makes sense he would be the default but the purple ribbon in the beard and the way he always sits like a boss really brings his rating up. Soi Fon also looks kinda basic with her captain's coat on, the yellow sash adds a nice pop of colour, but when she takes that off and has her whole back exposed that fit goes hard. Gin's fit is also basic but with his demeanour he kinda pulls it off but it's still just mid Unohana with the long front braid and that belt really shows a unique style that works for her and it totally distorts her body shape so you don't know that she has some serious cannons under there. Aizen's captain fit was as basic as they come, he baically looked like a high school maths teacher although he did prove the troupe of becoming hot when you remove your glasses and let your hair down. Byakuya's fit seems kinda basic but accessorising with the scarf and those hair pins really make him stand out and then later on when he gets the coat with the high collar and the gold edges, my boy really upgrades his fit after Aizen's defeat. Komamura's armour goes hard and  even after he removed the helmet the wooden pauldrons and gauntlets really give him and intimidating presence, although he is also 9 foot tall. Kyoraku stands out the most mostly because he wears a bright pink kimono, that along with the hat gives him a nice laid back style that is perfect for him and that nice light blue belt that fades down in to white was a great choice. Tosen's fit goes harder than it has any right to; the purple belt, the orange scarf that twirls up and the visor, when he betrayed the SS they lost half their style points. Toshiro is kinda basic but his hair is always on point and that sash with the clasp to hold his sword on his back really pushes him up in the style rankings and when he later turns that sash in to a scarf that was an upgrade.Kenpachi's fit goes hard, his hair looks kind goofy but the rest of his fit more than makes up for it, the exposed chest showing off some bandages and the rough cut sleeveless coat is an immaculate choice. Mayuri's fits always go crazy, this man could probably cure cancer and invent time travel but he's spending that time curating the most ostentatious fits known to man and I'm down for it.

21327,"Saigon native Lynn Lee has long wanted to open a Vietnamese restaurant that offers the kind of food she grew up eating. Fresh. Simple. Authentic. With no MSG or unnecessary preservatives. Plus something served in a fast fashion since, as the mom of two, she knows how busy families are and how hard it is to eat healthy while in a hurry.  That dream is now a reality with the opening of Saigon Table in Rye. The 28-seat fast casual space, with two kiosks for ordering upon entry and a grab-and-go section on the right, will have its soft opening May 21 with the grand opening - complete with a rickshaw from China - on May 23.The seeds of a businessThe child of Chinese parents, Lee came to the U.S. (specifically Seattle) from Saigon at age 11. Her parents worked long hours when she was growing up so she started cooking for herself at a young age. Then, as she grew older and had a family - she now lives in Greenwich, Connecticut with her kids at Rye Country Day - she wanted her children to eat the food of her youth and be culinary diverse eaters. That meant also understanding Chinese food.She also has a passion for educating others about classic Vietnamese food, which includes dishes that work for both lunch and dinner.""For me, it's the herbs, the freshness of the ingredients like lemongrass and Thai basil; everything is fresh,"" stressed Lee. ""I never saw dried seasoning in my life until I came to the U.S.""She's so meticulous about her food quality that she taught her chefs (though they are both culinary trained) to replicate the recipes she grew up with. They are Jon Lim and Operations Manager Dennis Lake (who's a chef and restaurateur himself; he owns La Taqueria in Greenwich and Darien).On the menu (and all cooked to order): Pho (with either sirloin, meatball or brisket); Vermicelli (with a choice of skewer, egg roll or both): Vietnamese beef stew; Chicken Soup (with glass or thin egg noodles); Banh Mi (with options of ham, pork, beef, chicken, shrimp or tofu; Summer Roll with shrimp; Tamarind Pork Ribs; Crispy Egg Rolls (the only item on the menu that's fried); and Grilled Skewers, with a variety of meat and tofu options.Lee is particularly proud of the Pandan chiffon cake dessert flavored with the juices of Pandanus amaryllifolius leaves.Drinks include a Vietnamese limeade made with fresh lime and club soda and seven signature cocktails including a classic margarita, an Aczu Gin and Toni (with juniper berries, fresh fruit, elderberry tonic, Topo Chico and gin); Mai Thai and Skinny Margarita with Cucumber. Lake said they're using Aldez, a small-batch producer who specializes in tequila but recently branched into mezcal. (Drinks must be ordered at the bar and not at the kiosk.)There's also wine and beer.What's the ambiance like?Lee, a first time restaurateur, also designed the decor, based on an open kitchen concept. ""I wanted it to have a sleek look with clean lines,"" she said. ""And I wanted it to feel like an escape from your daily grind.""Diners can expect a high ceiling, lots of bamboo wood, counter seating (with windows that open up to the street), a separate (small) bar area, a communal high top table and cushioned seating along the wall to the right. The color scheme is mainly neutral (think blonde and black) with orange accents. Neon signs read ""Saigon"" towards the front and a ""Bar"" sign by the bar.There's also a bicycle in the front, a nod to the main form of transportation in Vietnam.And, for even more of an education on the country, there's a video loop showcasing rotating images of its food and travel highlights that bring a burst of color to the space. The walls also feature photos of the area. The loop (on the back entry side) informs customers about the build-out of the space which includes a lot of custom details (including the epoxy-like floor). Though Lee signed the lease last April, the project was five years in the making.The two kiosks for ordering near the front play into her ""fast and efficient"" theme though you can also order at the counter.As for the restaurant's name, Lee said it comes from the fact that she's from Saigon. Plus table, for her, means having the family sitting down eating together. ""That's how it was for me growing up,"" she said. ""My father insisted we sit and focus on our food.""Her mission, she added, is to ""continue the tradition of eating high quality Vietnamese food"" along with good customer service.""The goal is to create a place where everyone feels at home.""Jeanne Muchnick covers food and dining.

21419,"fran√ßais au bas This kitchen re-organization almost took me all weekend. Not because it was really long per se, or I had loads to do, but because thinking it and making it actually happen was a bit more challenging. I remember the time when I had to design a space for one kid, how easy it was. But now with 3, I really need to make my little grey cells work more to make something that fills everybody's needs. There were many constraint in creating the kids kitchen corners: the fact that E is more and more on his feet and is also able to open drawers, so fragile or dangerous things need to be out of his reach the fact that X is wanting more and more to be independent in the kitchen X is bigger then M, so I needed to be able to put things in a spot they both can reach the size of my kitchen the number of drawers and cupboards in the said kitchen... And there were loads of things I wanted in creating this. The criteria were: help E become acquainted in the kitchen, and have his basic things available to him. have a space that would hold all the necessities to make a snack or a light lunch, and since this place was to have dangerous material for a younger child, it needed to be out of his reach have a space where all the material to set a table would be every item should be easily accessible and ""seeable"" and within reach of the person concerned Before going on, I need to say that we are not trying to segregate our kid's stuff vs our stuff here. Our purpose is to make sure that the kitchen is adapted to our children until they are able to function as we do in there. This is why there are not that many snacks available to them, or fruit bowl especially for them, since they are within their reach already. Same holds true for kitchen items. We are providing them with smaller size utensils and plates until they are big enough to use our standard size plates. I see X going frequently to the regular cupboard to get the things he needs, where as M is too small still. ok, back to the planning... Needless to say, it would have been easier if I had 3 kitchens or at least 3 spare drawers to work with. But since this was not the case, I had to work with what I had: one shelf, and one drawer I started by trying to put the snack prep area (with the snack boxes) in the food pantry (where the available shelve is). It was just logical to put the snacks with the rest of our food. But it just didn't work. I multiplied the ways to organized things in there, but I just couldn't make it work . It took me all weekend to try one thing, and then try another one, until I finally manage to think outside the box, and find the solution. Swaping the snack and dishes area. And voil√†. It is all I needed to do . On the left, a tray to carry items to the table, and then paper napkins and placemat behind (no, they currently don't match ...). IN the back there is a bigger size pitcher. This is the one we use to use before I found the smaller ones you can see. I still left it there because it is the right size for X now. Then we have small size pitchers to serve water or juice, with glasses that are perfect for a child's hand. Even E can use those. And finally on the right size, small size bowls and plate, and in the back, cereal bowls (they like to start their day with a cheery bowl) a word on kitchen material for kids. Montessori services and many other Montessori store have absolutely wonderful material for children. They are perfectly sized and well made. But do not underestimate your local kitchen or dollar store. I have been on the lookout forever for a child friendly size pitcher. And after 1 year more of searching, 3 of them came up at my local kitchen store. They were 2,50 each. They contain 600ml, and I just love them. Perfect size, pours wonderfully, and sturdy. Same for glasses, I found them for 35 cents. They are gin glasses. The bowls are small serving bowls, and the plates are tiny plates for bread and butter service. Just think outside the box, and you won't need to pay a lot to find things that are suited for your children. L'organisation de la cuisine m'a pris pratiquement tout le weekend. Pas parce que √ßa demandait beaucoup de travail, mais parce qu'il y avait beaucoup de contraintes √† prendre en consid√©ration. Je me rappelle du temps o√π je n'avais qu'√† organiser pour un enfant. Maintenant, avec 3, d'√¢ge diff√©rent, l'organization demande un peu plus de travail √† mes petites cellules grises. Voici les contraintes que j'avais: Le fait que E est de plus en plus toujours sur ses peids, et qu'il est capable d'ouvrir les tiroirs. Les choses fragiles ou dangereuse devaient de plus √™tre √† se port√©e le fait que X veut √™tre de plus en plus ind√©pendant dans la cuisine X est beaucoup plus grand que M, donc je devais trouver un espace qu'il peuvent joindre tout les 2, mais pas E La grosseur de ma cuisine, et le nombre restreint de panneaux... Les crit√®res de cr√©ations: Aide E √† devenir familier dans la cuisine et l'aider a acqu√©rir de l'ind√©pendance en lui donnant acc√®s √† ses choses Avoir un espace contenant tout les outils n√©cessaires pour se pr√©parer une collation ou un petit gouter, et que cet espace ne soit pas atteignable pour E Avoir un espace contenant tout le mat√©riel n√©cessaire pour mettre la table Qu'√† chaque fois tout le mat√©riel soit visible et facile a prendre pour les personnes concern√©es Avant de continuer, je dois dire que notre but n,est pas de s√©parer les choses des enfants des notre, mais bien de leur fournir les outils et espaces n√©cessaires jusqu'√† ce qu'ils soient en mesure de fonctionner comme nous dans la cuisine. De retour √† l'organisation... J'ai pris out le week end pour tourner et retourner les choses, je n'arrivais pas √† faire fonctionner les espaces √† mon go√ªt, jusqu'√† ce que je r√©ussisse √† penser autrement, et arriver √† la solution voir images Les assiettes et verres sont dans le garde manger. C'√©tait l'endroit le plus pratique pour les mettre. De gauche √† droite: plateau pour transport de mat√©riel, serviettes de table et napperons, broc (tout neuf, je les adores!) de 600ml, et verres pour le service des boissons, et finalement, bols et assiettes. Un mot sur le mat√©riel de cuisine. Il existe des tonnes de boutiques Montessori qui vendent des trucs vraiment extras pour les enfants. Mais ne sous estimez pas vos boutique de cuisine locales. Si vous regardez bien, elles regorgent de mat√©riel qui peuvent √™tre utilis√©s parfaitement pour les enfants: Les verres sont des verres √† gin, les assiettes, des assiettes a beurre. Les bols color√©s dans le fond (pour les c√©r√©ales du matin) des bol a tapas. Tout ces produits m'ont pratiquement rien cout√©, et je n'avais pas de frais de port...",NEUTRAL,2

21815,"Chris Meloni may be best known for playing hardened Detective Elliot Stabler on ""Law &amp; Order: SVU"" and ""Law &amp; Order: Organized Crime"" (and maybe for dining with Gov. Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

So we'll do some of those things right now for you to kind of help you right now, as well as do some of those tests that I mentioned.

So we need to make sure some of that, swelling goes down, if we need to adjust your medications while you're here.

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

Uhm, and it's it happens in old age, it happens with wear and tear so to diagnose it, we we'll, yeah, we did the physical exam. We can also get an x-ray of your hips and knees which can have some findings that align with osteoarthritis and basically for now we'll try to manage it conservatively so you can take and sets like ibuprofen for the pain or acetaminophen for the pain. We'll also refer you to physiotherapy to strengthen those muscles around your joint and to increase flexibility and reduce that pain. Uhm, and another thing that may be worth considering is occupational therapy because they can help you find ways to do everyday tasks without putting too much stress on an already painful joint.

23263,"&gt;Maybe because the game doesn't have like a strong/serious central plot? I remember other moeges I've enjoyed have some kind of a central plot to them; Aokana/Majikoi/Walkure Romanze (the tournament), HoshiOri/Koichoco (the school event), IMHHW (the club).Ginharu is all about everyday life, to experience a realistic romance and couple life. I always feel like forced plot points ruin that. Make it feel fabricated instead of realistic. I like Tone Work's moege because there is this laid back flow to it. You should not ask: ""when is the next plot twist coming or drama moment unfolding."" The point is to self insert and have a cute romance, enjoying cute couple everyday life. In that sense no other moege come even close to Tone Work's.&gt;Maybe because the romance development in Ginharu feels short? I think most moeges I like have decent amount of time in romance development. In Ginharu (atleast in the routes I've read so far) you pretty much confessed before you even reach highschool.I see it the opposite way, in other words it is a plus and why Ginharu ruined literally any other moege for me.

Then come to find out, this was Hatch Distilling's first whiskey that was fermented, distilled, and aged on site in Egg Harbor WI, and wow, what a way to start! Fermentation is a huge part of whiskey, especially Single Malt.  With this release they're paying homage to the Godfather of fermentation, Robert 'Doc' Wahl. Getting into the particulars, on the nose, this is strikingly dry hay/alfalfa, dry cereal and honey.  It's fairly pungent and dense, but there's also a subtle light fruit coming through.  Onto the taste and there is no surprise right away.  It's a sweet, grain heavy initial taste, followed by a tangy sweetness that's almost fruity.  The honeyed breadiness is a common thread throughout the entire sip right up until the very end.  Right at the very back end, it turns into caramel, toffee, and a nice warming spice. That spice carries all the way through the finish with glimpses of the cereal, honey, fruit, and a touch of bitterness to really round things out.  Egg Harbor is up in door county, the thumb of WI. With lots of tourism in the area, if you find yourself anywhere near, the distillery is well worth the visit.  They make a plethora of spirits and their gin is my favorite gin I've had to date.

24081,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

24082,"The Negroni is a classic cocktail that the world has fallen back in love with over the past few years, and with good reason, because it's absolutely delicious. Beautiful in its simplicity ‚Äì just a mix of equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth over ice, the cocktail is so perfect in fact that you might ask, why mess with a good thing? Because experimentation is the catalyst for innovation! Plus, it's just fun. Dissecting the classic recipe we decided to substitute the gin with blanco Tequila and add some 18.21 Blood Orange + Ginger Shrub to give this cocktail some extra flair. The tequila really works well to balance the bitterness of the Campari and adds some fresh agave essence without removing the complete flavor profile of the Negroni we all enjoy. The shrub from 18.21 was introduced to create a little wow factor for your taste buds as the cocktail was still too similar to the classic and we wanted it to stand out from the crowd. We found the blood orange did a great job of integration with the profile of the Campari and the addition of ginger really made this Negroni fresh and bright on the palate. We think you'll absolutely love it While this drink might seem unorthodox to some, we feel that rules are meant to be broken, and purists don't know what they're missing. If you feel the need to change up the garnish, swap out the orange twist for a dehydrated lime wheel. If you're looking for a touch of oaky, vanilla sweetness, put down the blanco and give it a whirl with some aged tequila.Ingredients:Produce:1/2 oz 18.21 blood orange + ginger shrub1 Orange, TwistFrozen:1 1/2 cups IceBeer, Wine &amp; Liquor:1 oz Blanco tequila1 oz Campari1 oz Sweet vermouth",NEUTRAL,2

But given that it's symmetrical, you have the morning stiffness that doesn't go away for more than 30 minutes and just the pattern of where those where the stiffness and pain is occurring itt sounds more likely to be rheumatoid arthritis, especially since you've also, you also have another autoimmune condition with hypothyroidism, it's more likely to be another autoimmune condition. So what we will do is get a few tests done. This will involve some blood work as well. And we will also get some imaging done, so we will get like the CRP and ESR for inflammatory markers we will get like your full CBC blood count we will get rheumatoid factor test done as well as antinuclear antibody and a lot of other different just markers to rule out anything else besides rheumatoid arthritis and then we will also get just X-Rays of your hands and feet as well.

26681,"KNOW YOUR DRINK: SPIRITS 1O1""Spirits"" are distilled liquors made from fermenting grains, fruits, or vegetables. The distillation process involves heating the fermented liquid to separate alcohol from water and other components, resulting in a higher concentration of alcohol. Here are the key types of spirits and some details about each:1. Whiskey:   - Made from fermented grain mash (barley, corn, rye, and wheat).   - Types include bourbon, Scotch, rye, and Irish whiskey.   - Typically aged in wooden casks, which impart flavor and color.2. Vodka:   - Made from fermented grains or potatoes.   - Distilled multiple times to achieve high purity and a neutral flavor.   - Often used in cocktails due to its versatility.3. Rum:   - Made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses or sugarcane juice.   - Varieties include light, dark, and spiced rum.   - Commonly associated with tropical regions and used in drinks like mojitos and pi√±a coladas.4. Gin:   - Made from distilled grains and flavored with juniper berries and other botanicals.   - Styles include London Dry, Plymouth, and Old Tom gin.   - Essential ingredient in classic cocktails like the martini and gin and tonic.5. Tequila:   - Made from the blue agave plant, primarily in the region surrounding Tequila, Mexico.   - Types include blanco (silver), reposado (rested), and a√±ejo (aged).   - Often consumed neat or used in cocktails like margaritas.6. Brandy:   - Made by distilling wine or fermented fruit juice.   - Types include cognac (from the Cognac region of France) and Armagnac (from the Armagnac region of France).   - Often enjoyed as an after-dinner drink.Each type of spirit has its own unique production methods, flavor profiles, and cultural significance. Distillation not only increases the alcohol content but also concentrates flavors, allowing each spirit to offer a distinct drinking experience. Moreover, aging in barrels can add complexity, with flavors ranging from vanilla and caramel to smoke and spice.Spirits are often enjoyed in cocktails, sipped neat, or on the rocks. They play a central role in many social and cultural rituals worldwide, from casual gatherings to formal celebrations.Check each photo here for more details. ü•ÉHospitality ProblemsReference:https://www.vinepair.comCOCKTAIL IDEAS:‚Ä¢ https://www.facebook.com/share/EBEWjpzSHi1UcoyW/?mibextid=WC7FNe‚Ä¢ https://www.facebook.com/share/HT6qvgvdSRQ6vCVb/?mibextid=WC7FNeBartending Basic Techniques:https://www.facebook.com/share/p/DHAXuJ45UTonPT19/?mibextid=WC7FNe",NEUTRAL,2

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

27536,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

It could also be other respiratory infections, especially viral infections this time of the year. And so, if it comes back negative for COVID, it's probably you know something else like respiratory virus or even the flu. So we'll go from there. And if it turns out it's not a viral infection, we will likely see if it's some sort of bacterial infection in which we can prescribe antibiotics for those. But it definitely sounds like there's an infectious picture going on here because of the acuteness of the presentation, and just your symptoms. So we will do afollow up in a week or so.

As far as spirits go, it's fundamentally different from a bourbon that requires a certain kind of distilling and ageing technique, often restricted to certain places as by legal geographic requirement. That said, gin has history too, originally as a means to use up excess wine grapes via distilling and flavouring with juniper. This began in Flanders and juniper is the most quintessential gin flavouring. Dutch jenever, often sold in ceramic bottles, is a must try for any gin fans. The modern style gin is however English, as its rise to popularity in England in the 18th century. Today English gins like Gordon's are the legacy of that history and probably best answer your question. But there are so many types of  gin now. Japan and Australia, just two examples, are making great gins flavoured with local and indigenous herbs. So who knows what  you may prefer once you try a few.",NEUTRAL,2

27966,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

There isn't one that I know of that grows their own grain, corn. Louisville is a city and there isn't a distillery that I know of that is big enough to grow their own supplies, yet small enough to not have to buy in bulk industrial quantities to meet demand. Makers Mark grows their own red winter wheat and has their own local water source, but even they don't grow corn or source 100% of their water from their own source. They are also way outside of Louisville at Loretta, Kentucky. Personally I think that the location and style of rickhouse makes the whiskey more than mash ingredients, as the mash loses most of it's character during distillation. The vanilla and oak flavors that bourbon is known for are coming from the charred oak.All that said, there are still great opportunities to enjoy some bourbon in Louisville. Liquor Barn tasting bar in Springhurst has a ton of whiskeys at the best prices you'll see, Neat has some bottles that were made before you were born, the secondary market prices (no hate if that's not your thing) are the best in the world.

The only one I actually asked for was the first scotch, everything else was just offered to me.Then came the nearly 10 hour layover. My connecting flight boards in 30 minutes. I've done my best to pace myself but they make really good old fashions in the EWR Polaris lounge, especially when you sub the Bullet Rye for Lagavulin 8 (think smoky and savory). The bartenders kept offering me Bailey's for my coffees, but it's not a real Irish coffee unless you add a splash of Irish whisky, right? The bartender also recommended a negroni with the gin subbed for Smokey mezcal, and wow those were also good!

Like after pregnancy as well, so that's something that is definitely on the differential, and at this time we definitely need to make sure she's okay and get her vitals done, see her oxygenation saturation, and just do supportive care while she's in the hospital, and we may need to admit her, but we'll do the full physical examination today, get a COVID swab done as well. And usually it, she's currently in the, it seems to be the second phase, where she's vomiting and coughing a lot, and then it usually, after that phase, two or three more weeks of just coughing.

Pour a bottle of red wine overtop and cover with a lid or cloth and store in a cool dry place out of direct sunlight for 48 hrs.Once 2 days is up, fine strain into medium sized pot (discard the solids) and add in your sugar, heating on low until the sugar is just dissolved. Kill the heat, set aside to cool. Once cooled add your gin and bottle!

29328,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

Someone at work once mentioned they thought a visiting speaker had been drinking, because they could smell alcohol adding ""unless it's you or Julie"" - meaning it as a joke because professional women wouldn't be drinking, right?  My downfall took a while to come.  The first thing was noticing my vision seemed a bit blurred driving home - led on to getting shakes towards the end of the day.  I thought this was anxiety, EVENTUALLY realised it was withdrawal symptoms.  I remember going to the pub with my partner, he noticed I was shaky.  I usually drank lager/cider, but was too shaky to manage a pint so had neat gin instead to stop it.  He didn't realise then.  Went on holiday with partner - unlike many ""normal"" people I was drinking less on holiday because of someone always being around.  Found I couldn't walk down steps because my legs were so shaky they gave way.  Again, withdrawal symptoms.  This led on to drinking to stop withdrawal symptoms, drinking vodka as it worked quick, and from there things got bad very fast.  Luckily I ended up in hospital rather than prison.",NEUTRAL,2

30339,"In a tiny state overflowing with nearly 30 different craft breweries, beer-makers get plenty of buzz.But if you're looking for a real buzz ‚Äï and one that packs a punch stronger than any brew ‚Äï Delaware's six spirit-makers have you covered.And since May 22 is National Distillery Day, you have an excuse to try a First State vodka, bourbon, rum or gin on a Wednesday without raising too many eyebrows, even though it is also officially ""hump day.""Five of Delaware's homespun distilleries have tasting rooms, allowing you to swing by and either buy a bottle of craft spirits or take a seat for a pour or a homemade cocktail. Bear-based Diamante Distillers, opened in 2019, is the lone Delaware distillery without a tasting room, but officials there say they are planning to open one next year.Diamante produces only one brand, Blu Steel Vodka, which is also available in lemon, vanilla, orange and grapefruit flavors. You can find it on liquor shelves not only across Delaware, but also Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington, D.C.If you're looking for a spot where you can pull up a chair and sample the hard stuff, these are your five options in the state.Dogfish Head Distilling (320 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach, and 6 Cannery Village Center, Milton)Delaware's biggest craft brewery also has the largest distilling operation, offering nearly 30 different ""off-centered"" bottles, along with an array of canned cocktails.Spirits include rum, gin, vodka, whiskey and more, including a pumpkin liqueur. Their Prohibition-inspired bottle of Sonic Archeology, which blends Dogfish Head whiskey, rum and apple brandy with honey along with lemon and pomegranate juices, is among the most unique.In terms of the on-the-go canned cocktails Dogfish has added in recent years, they offer everything from tequila margaritas, rum Mai Tais and vodka mules to vodka lemonades, vodka crushes and a gin crush.Painted Stave Distilling (106 W. Commerce St., Smyrna)Link to ImageSince 2013, Painted Stave has been producing bottles of vodka, whiskey, gin and liqueurs in the heart of Smyrna using local ingredients. (That's why they don't make rum ‚Äï there's no sugar cane produced in the First State.)One of their most fun releases has been their Off the Hoof scrapple-flavored vodka, complete with a cartoon tattooed pink pig on the label. At their tasting room and cocktail garden, try the Pig Pen Martini made with Off the Hoof vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and olives.Beach Time Distilling (32191 Nassau Road, near Lewes)Link to ImageEntering its 10th season next year, Beach Time is a small distillery run by owner Greg Christmas about just off Del. 1, about four miles west of downtown Lewes.You can find him or his staff slinging drinks at the small beach-themed tasting room with 10 cocktails to choose from, including the Volcano (Beach Nut Toasted Coconut Rum, pineapple juice, pink guava nectar and muddled lime), the Fire Storm (Beach Fire Spiced Rum and ginger beer) and the Juiceman Sour (Juiceman White Whiskey and simple syrup).UNIQUE FIRST STATE SIPS From Big Beers &amp; Swamp Water to Dewey Devils &amp; Shark Attacks: 13 must-try Delaware drinksSpirits available in bottles include six rum varieties, gin, vodka and bourbon.  easySpeak Spirits (586 Milford Harrington Highway, Milford)Fourteen cocktails and 19 different bottled spirits are produced at Milford easySpeak, which also offers a full food menu of bar bites, quesadillas, salads, pizzas, sandwiches and seven different macaroni and cheese varieties including eye-poppers such as filet mignon, shrimp or lobster.Try the Creamsicle Float made with orange vodka, fresh orange juice, vanilla and milk, topped with bubbles and maybe bring home a bottle of black cherry rum.Feebs Distilling Co. (733 McColley St., Milford)Owned by Eric and Stacey and Eric Fibelkorn, Feebs grew out of Eric's hobby of making moonshine at home.Now they offer sweet homemade flavored brandies (apple, blueberry, blackberry, peach and strawberry) at their distillery, along with aged whiskey bourbon and ""Unaged Korn Whiskey,"" his original ""white lighting"" moonshine recipe.In their tasting room, they sell seven varieties of their popular alcoholic slushies: ""Hillbilly Lemonade,"" peach/mango, strawberry/watermelon, ""Apple Pie,"" ""Feebs-a Rita,"" blueberry punch and Old Fashioned.Have a story idea?

That can be a bit of a problem because bees are so attracted to them they avoid other plants.""So getting in there and removing the blossoms, I created an infused gin which was lovely.""Her husband works in the distilling business, with hopes the experiment could lead to a bigger batch of the balsam-infused gins.However, there are strict rules around the handling of the plant to avoid transporting seeds, with a special licence required.The bright pink flowers can grow up to two metres tall - and in doing so, can crowd out native plants as well as cause riverbank erosion, raising flood risks.With this week marking Invasive Non- Native Species Week, Ross Watson of Woodland Trust Scotland said businesses like Samantha's showed how communities could get involved in solving the invasive plants crisis by finding innovative solutions.He said the gin was a ""very Instagrammable, very appealing product that could be utilised as a way of harvesting balsam"".",NEUTRAL,2
