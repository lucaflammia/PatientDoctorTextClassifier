30675,"Believe it or not, we're almost halfway through 2024.¬†What's more, summer is on our doorstep, and it's already time to swap out those leather-strapped dress watches for things we can take in the water. And while 2024 hasn't been what we'd consider a dive watch super-year, we've certainly received our fair share of compelling, aquatically themed timepieces ‚Äî especially amongst the mid-tier price segment, that horological sweet spot that, while not quite impulse-buy territory, provides tons of value without making you hide from your significant other for a week following a purchase. Products of the Week: TAG Heuer Watches, Gin and Zegna Trousers The 8 best pieces of garb and gear that crossed our desks this week If what you want is something you can truly beat the hell out of without worrying about it, then Victorinox has your back with its new Dive Pro series in titanium and steel. Looking for a sober, Submariner-like diver that doesn't cost Submariner money? Tudor's new monochromatic Black Bay 41 is just the ticket. And what about something more irreverent, something positively oozing color? The newest entry in Zodiac's Compression series, with its bright pops of green and blue, should be right up your alley. And one other thing: we generally advocate for buying a watch on its bracelet ‚Äî if that's an option ‚Äî as it's often more cost-effective to buy an after-market rubber or NATO option later. So if you find something below that you like but you want a rubber or other strap to use in the water, check out this handy strap guide containing some of our favorite aftermarket options. Other than that, enjoy some of our favorite divers from 2024 thus far. There are sure to be more exciting new models as the year unfolds!¬† Victorinox Dive Pro Victorinox is good for much more than just a Swiss Army Knife. In fact, its new Dive Pro watches, available in both quartz and automatic versions, are positively brimming with value, offering serious specs and robust construction at the roughly $1,000 mark. ISO 6425-certified and rated to 300m of water resistance, they offer steel or titanium case construction and your choice of paracord or rubber strap. The automatic versions, powered by Sellita movements, boast 38 hours of power reserve, while those running on Ronda quartz movements provide 60 months of run time. Measuring 43mm, they're not for the faint of wrist ‚Äî but they're perfect for summertime adventuring both in and out of the water. Diameter: 43mm Movement: Sellita SW220-1 automatic; Ronda 715 quartz Water Resistance: 300m Victorinox : $800 ‚Äì $1,500 Wren Driver One Aqua The brainchild of the team behind Wrist Enthusiast, the Diver One is a vintage-inspired tool watch with great looks to match its impressive-for-its-price feature set. Measuring 41mm wide and 13.3mm tall, its PVD-coated case retains its steel coloring but increases hardness, while its unidirectional, black sapphire timing bezel mirrors the look of mid-20th century divers. The dial, which fades from an aqua blue color to black at the edges, features ""sandwich"" construction and an ample amount of lume for low-light activity. The steel flat-link bracelet, meanwhile, will be familiar to fans of vintage Omega Speedmasters; here, it helps the Diver One sit comfortably on the wrist without adding too much thickness. Diameter: 41mm Movement: Sellita SW200 automatic Water Resistance: 200m Wrist Enthusiast : $895 Doxa SUB 200T Dive watch pioneer Doxa distilled down its beloved collection into the perfect, 39mm tool watch and slapped a price tag on it that had every watch journalist's mouth watering in Geneva this past April. Available in all of Doxa's classic colorways ‚Äî in both ""Iconic"" (matte) and ""Sunray"" versions, its tonneau-shaped steel case wears beautifully; its classic no-decompression bezel is present and accounted for; its iconic dial with oversized minute hand is as visible and legible as ever; and the beloved beads-of-rice bracelet is an option, as is a dial-matching rubber strap. Measuring just 10.7mm thick and water resistant to 200m, it positively screams ""summer,"" especially in the bright-yellow Diving Star or safety-orange Professional iterations. Diameter: 39mm Movement: Sellita SW200-1 automatic Water Resistance: 200m Doxa : $1,550 Zodiac Super Sea Wolf Compressor If you're on the hunt for a colorful dive watch that maintains some vintage inspiration whilst injecting a bit of whimsy into the equation, then you need to have Zodiac on your radar. Owned by the Fossil Group, Zodiac makes well-priced divers powered by movements from sister company STP, a movement manufacturer. Its newest Super Sea Wolf Compressor is particularly colorful, taking inspiration from sea turtles in a riot of green and blue. Housed in a 40mm steel case and paired to a comfortable five-link bracelet, it's water resistant to 200m and features a power reserve of 40 hours. Wear it beneath the waves; wear it around a tropical island destination; wear it around the big city ‚Äî this is a watch as hardy as it is fun. Zodiac : $1,695 Yema Superman Slim CMM.20 There's no question that Morteau-based Yema is making some of the most compelling watches in the sub-$5K category, full stop. To wit, the Superman Slim CMM.20, a fresh version of the firm's famed dive watch from the mid-20th century, it has several notable features. First of all, it's powered by an automatic micro-rotor movement, developed in-house, that measures just 3.7mm thick and features a 70-hour power reserve. Then, it has an incredible ""Scales Slim"" steel bracelet that tapers down to the buckle. On top of this, it's available in beautiful blue or black enamel lacquer dials that proudly say ""Manufacture Fran√ßauise,"" reflecting the brand's local production of key components. And the case size? Perfect. Yema : $2,490 Longines Hydroconquest GMT 43mm While most watch companies ‚Äî including this one, to be fair ‚Äî are finally downsizing their products, Longines decided an upsized version of the Hydroconquest GMT was in order, which is good news for the larger-wristed among us. Measuring 43mm, this new version is a combination dive watch/travel watch with an impressive feature set: 300m of water resistance; a rotating, ceramic timing bezel; a GMT complication; an automatic movement with a silicon balance spring and 72 hours of power reserve; and a stainless steel bracelet to match the polished and satin-brushed case. If you're on the prowl for a tool watch that checks multiple boxes, this one ‚Äî which comes in several dial colors ‚Äî is sort of a no-brainer at $2,975. Longines : $2,975 Bremont Supermarine 300M Date British watchmaking's star child completely revamped its lineup under the direction of CEO Davide Cerrato. The new Supermarine 300M Date eschews the brand's Trip-Tick case in place of a thinner, more conventional 40mm housing constructed from 904L stainless steel. Available in several colors and strap options, the most compelling, to our minds, is the black dial on a cool, quick-release steel bracelet with beautifully brushed and polished links. Water resistant to 300m and powered by an automatic movement with 50 hours of power reserve, it may be a little less distinct than previous Supermarine models ‚Äî but its sub-$4K price tag makes up for this. Diameter: 40mm Movement: Calibre 11 1/2''' BE-92AV automatic Water Resistance: 300m Bremont : $3,950 Tudor Black Bay 41mm While you're not going to find a Rolex Submariner on a Jubilee bracelet in the brand's catalog, you can now buy a Black Bay 41mm from sister company Tudor in a classic, monochromatic black colorway on the company's own five-link bracelet with ""T-fit."" Powered by an in-house, Master Chronometer-certified movement with 70 hours of power reserve, this handsome diver is devoid of the faux-vintage ""gilt"" printing found on many other Tudors, which some folks love ‚Äî and others, less so. What's undeniable is just how handsome this watch is, with ""snowflake""-style hands, brushed and polished surfaces, a rose-signed crown, and a unidirectional steel bezel. At $4,550, it's one of the best buys in dive watches all day long. Diameter: 41mm Movement: Tudor Manufacture Calibre MT5602-U Water Resistance: 200m Tudor : $4,550 Omega Seamaster Diver 300M ""Paris 2024"" The brand from Biel/Bienne admittedly puts out lots of limited editions each year ‚Äî but this special Seamaster for the Olympic Games in Paris is particularly neat. A two-tone steel and 18K Moonshine Gold version of its famed dive watch, it features a white ""wave"" dial in the style of models worn by a certain famed British spy. The caseback, adorned with a frosted and mirror-polished gold Paris 2024 medallion, Olympic rings, and ""Paris 2024,"" is complemented by matching seconds hand likewise featuring the medallion. Water resistant to 300m and powered by the automatic Omega Calibre 8800, it of course comes in a special presentation box. Diameter: 42mm Movement: Omega Calibre 8800 automatic Water Resistance: 300m Omega : $8,900 Blancpain Fifty Fathoms Automatique 42mm Red Gold This one's for the diver who wants a touch of bling on his wrist: A smaller ‚Äî if you can believe it! ‚Äî 42.3mm version of the slightly older 45mm Fifty Fathoms, the new Automatique in red gold is a stunning piece of kit. Powered by the brand's Calibre 1315 automatic movement and featuring a black sunray dial with applied dart and Arabic indices, it's got a handy date wheel at 4:30 and a beautiful sapphire bezel insert. But besides the appealing combination of black and red gold color, one of this model's most endearing features is actually its least hi-tech attribute: The Tropic-style rubber strap it ships on is comfortable, thin, and easy to slip over a dry wrist or a wetsuit. And with five days of power reserve, you'll have no excuse to wear it all weekend‚Ä¶and beyond.

If they don't, or if nothing sounds appealing, I'll go for a gin and tonic, gin daisy (gin, grenadine, soda, lemon juice, usually over ice ‚Äî bartenders are not always familiar with this) or aperol spritz (not all bars have aperol, you sometimes need to ask if they can make this).

Uhm, and it's basically happens because of overuse, so vigorous physical activities that put repeated stress on your knees, like running and cycling, uhm, can cause that or just like improper sports training techniques. Uhm, we can do a few things that that'll help with the pain. So for a little bit, if you could hold off on the running that would be good. So, in the meantime, while you while you switch to like low impact activities, whether that's like riding a stationary bike or swimming, you can also try something called the RICE method and so that stands for resting, uhm, so avoiding putting any strain on that knee using ice packs for several days, compression, so wrapping your knee in like an elastic bandage, as well as elevating your knees higher than your, then the level of your chest can help. And then with the sharp pain you could also also take ibuprofen for pain management. Uhm, yeah, so we can start there if it doesn't get better we can also order an x-ray just to rule out other things that could have caused this pain in your knee. And if none of those nonsurgical treatments work, oh sorry, I also forgot to mention will also refer you to physiotherapy to help you with the range of motion and strength and endurance.

31954,"Check out the book Heal Your Headache or check out The Dizzy Cook - she has a summary of the book and all migraine food triggers. Link is below. Interestingly - dairy, sugar, gluten are not typical triggers. Nuts are, however. My guess is the almond milk was the trigger in the ice cream. The biggest issue is called tyramine and it builds up in foods over time so the biggest things to avoid are anything aged, fermented, pickled, preserved (including all alcohol, except maybe vodka, and any vinegar except distilled white vinegar). Also, any meat that's been cooked for more than 1-2 days. Histamine can also trigger migraines and is in food. It's very hard to say which specific foods trigger migraines because it could be something different each time. Chocolate might trigger a migraine on one day, and not on another day, depending on what else you've eaten or done.It's a very hard diet to adapt to, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad, and it's 100% worth it. I recommend doing a complete elimination for two weeks and then adding foods back in to test them. I try to follow it 100% at home (except for a few foods I've added back) and then when I'm out of the house I just do my best. Things I completely avoid, because I'm 90-100% confident they are triggers:SoyMSG (which is in a lot of things. MSG is technically a spice so I don't eat anything that just says ""spices"" on the ingredient label)All liquor except vodkaLeftover meat more than two days old Aged cheese (though I'm starting to test it in small quantities) Citric acidMaltodextrin, yeast extract, autolyzed yeast - according to the book these are basically MSGBeans other than black beansChocolate - I'll eat no more than one biteMushroomsCured meatCoffee - this is a weird one because sometimes it helps. But I'm now off it completely because of sleepAll bars with chocolate, nuts, or fake protein - I eat 88 Acres bars which are pretty much the only ones that are compliant Things I'll eat when I have to or in small quantities:YogurtOnions LentilsNutsParmesan Mixers in vodka, like other liqueurs, and other clear liquors like gin or tequilaThings I've added back completely:CitrusAvocadoMalted barley flour (though I still avoid it at home) All the histamine foods that aren't tyramine foods - salmon, spinach, strawberries, eggsTomatoeshttps://thedizzycook.com/category/hyh/",NEUTRAL,2

33062,"Gin and lemon are two flavors that were almost certainly designed by some higher power to be placed in the same glass. From the Aviation to the Tom Collins to the (in)famous Ramos Gin Fizz, gin, lemon, and sugar have been mixed together with astoundingly good results for over a century. The basics of this formula are generally referred to as the ""Gin Sour"" family of drinks, and it's a large family. The fun part of working within a drink family like the Gin Sour, is that by adding an ingredient here (like cr√®me de violette in the Aviation) or changing out the sweetener ‚Äì say from sugar to orgeat ‚Äì you can create an entirely new drink. Army Navy 2 oz Gin 1 oz Lemon 3/4 oz Orgeat 2 dashes Angostura Bitters Shake with ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg. Orgeat is a syrup made from almonds. The name is French and the syrup can often be found in tropical drinks like Mai Tais. One interesting fact about orgeat is that the name actually derives from the French word for barley, orge. Original recipes for orgeat were basically sugared barley water, in which barley was added to sugar and hot water and then steeped. Somewhere along the way people stopped using barley and switched to almonds, but the name never changed. We're very glad that the recipe went to almond instead of sticking to barley because the almond flavor in the Army Navy is superb. By taking the basic gin sour and replacing sugar with orgeat and adding a few dashes of bitters, the resulting drink is a cocktail with a fuller mouthfeel and rounder flavors thanks to the richness of the orgeat and the effect of the bitters on the entire conglomeration. ---- Matt ""RumDood"" Robold is a bartender at 320 Main and, in his spare time, runs RumDood.com, where he writes about rum, rum cocktails, and rum history.",NEUTRAL,2

The orthopaedic surgeon will uh, decide like which option is best for you after we refer you for a consult with them, and then after that surgery they'll likely refer you to some rehab, so physiotherapy will focus on improving your range of motion and strengthening the muscles in that area.

He then used his personal brand to scale the company, selling it for $610M just two years later. üç∏2. Be opportunistic and creative - Even if you don't have millions in investment capital, you can still find ways to invest in things you're passionate about and build a business that attracts like-minded people. üß†üí°3. Focus on the basics - Ryan invests in boring but essential things that everyone needs, like password software (1Password) and mobile plans (Mint Mobile).

You also clearly don't understand the Kawakawa case you likely reference.That gun culture is very different between the USA and NZ is both true but also broadly irrelevant. Self defense law in both is far more similar than different, both devolved from the same statutory source. If you attack me in NZ and I defend myself with a gun, self-defense is wholly legitimate as a potential defence in court. I may own or possess the weapon illegally and may be separately charged for same, given its much harder to obtain firearms in NZ than the USA, and given laws on firearms generally are stricter, but that does not invalidate the doctrine of legal self-defense.However, my right to defend myself is not invalidated by such. If I am otherwise behaving legally and can show I *acted reasonably in the purpose of defending myself, sincerely believing your intent to cause me serious or fatal harm*, there is no legal function with NZ law that would prevent my acquittal on grounds of self-defense, if I were actually even charged. Your farmer story only confirms the same. It's a viable defense. Indeed, the judge in that case instructed the jury to find not guilty *before* the trial began, which they did after short deliberation, based upon the facts. A secondary gun charge was also dismissed. Who's *making stuff up* about NZ here?These types of cases may certainly be far *rarer* in NZ, certainly, but that's a wholly different discussion. You may want to re-read the early posts to remember what we were actually discussing. That NZ is different to the USA isn't an argument.That it's harder to own a gun doesn't change other legal principles. That's a wholly fallacious argument. I've lived in other counties with similarly strict laws on gun ownership to NZ (the UK being a good example) and the same legal concepts hold true there too.I hope you've learned something now about your country, and will stop saying a load of incorrect 'facts'.",NEUTRAL,2

The bones were uncovered in front of the Courville residence.Many stories were rife, but the most reasonable seems to be that of the old residents who claim the area was used as a burying ground before the present cemetery was located. It was supposed that all bodies had been removed to the new site, but there were perchance unmarked graves in which remains were left.Another story, which seems to have some grounds, is told of the body of an unknown sailor being washed up on the beach here many years ago, and being buried in about the same location.Theater still under construction The new theater building has now reached a stage in the course of construction, whereby the observer may sense the beauty of the structure when completed. The strength of the walls was given an accidental test the other day, when a 40 foot gin pole, used to hoist the tresses, fell against the unsupported tile wall.  Three tiles were broken and six knocked out of place, which proves the extreme care used in the construction.Traffic signal comingWith the opening of Main Street, the problem of traffic on the corner of Fourth and Main Streets will demand a solution. Before the paving was laid, the condition of the road solved the traffic problem at this point, as all cars were forced to slow down or the occupants or be jounced out.The necessity of a signal of some description is obvious and the Benzie County Power Co. has presented to the council a proposition, whereby the village may obtain an automatic signal at cost.",NEUTRAL,2

34597,"For a long time, the taxman's basket of excise taxes was nearly full of collections from individuals who could hardly resist a nicotine rush or a sip of the frothy stuff.  Because excise taxes were drawn mainly from cigarettes and alcohol they were christened 'sin taxes'. But the government has since found a new cash cow for excise taxes.  The latest Economic Survey by the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) shows that collection from financial transactions and airtime has overtaken 'sin taxes' to become the leading source of excise duty, as the government expands the basket of excisable products beyond alcohol and tobacco. In the financial year 2022/24, excise duty from financial transactions and airtime amounted to Sh80 billion compared to Sh62.66 billion from alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, data from KNBS shows. A big chunk of the financial transactions includes fees on mobile money transfers such as Safaricom's M-Pesa through which more than half of the country's economy is transacted.  The collection of excise taxes from financial transactions and airtime first overtook those from alcohol and cigarettes in the year ending June 2022 and the gap has since grown bigger as activities around money transfers and telecommunications services have increased. Excise taxes on financial transactions and airtime now account for 47.9 percent of the total collections compared to 37.5 percent on alcoholic drinks and tobacco products, analysis of data from the National Treasury shows. Excise taxes tend to target such harmful products as alcohol and cigarettes, not only to discourage people from engaging in those activities but also to raise taxes from consumers who will not be scared by a higher cost. Although the collection of excise duty from beer increased last year, there are also fears that consumption per unit might have dropped as consumers go for cheaper alternatives, including counterfeit drinks. Similarly, a combination of health awareness campaigns, regulations and punitive taxes, have made smoking unpopular. With the revenue streams from tobacco and alcohol drying up, the government has turned to new areas such as financial transactions and airtime to increase revenues to finance its ever-expanding budget. Robert Waruiru, a tax expert, reckons that this points to the critical role that financial inclusion plays. ""I also think it demonstrates the elastic nature of demand for tobacco and cigarettes, which should hopefully inform our future tax and fiscal policy,"" said Mr Waruiru. ""This also shows the diminishing disposable income for individuals and highlights the need to review PAYE (pay-as-you-earn) structure,"" he added. In the proposed revenue-raising measures for the financial year 2024/25, starting in July, the government expects to collect more from financial transactions and spirits through fresh amendments. Excise duty on fees on financial transactions, including banking fees, will rise to 20 percent from the current 15 percent should the National Assembly approve Treasury proposals. The Finance Bill 2024 has also proposed higher taxes on spirits by applying the duty based on pure alcohol content. Excise duty on tobacco products has been increased as the government moves to harmonise taxes on cigarettes with filters with those without filters. ""Excise duty is a tax imposed by the government on certain products with negative externalities to discourage their consumption. In addition, excise duty is also charged on other goods and services to generate revenue,"" said the National Treasury in the 2023 Medium Term Revenue Strategy. In the medium term, President William Ruto's administration has indicated its intention to review excise duty on petroleum products, betting and gaming; and introduce excise duty on coal and other goods with harmful health effects such as sugar. The basket of excise taxes has evolved from the 1980s and 1990s when it was dominated by alcohol and tobacco products at 80 percent.   But since being introduced in 2015, financial transactions is the single largest contributor towards the excise duty pot, with the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collecting S5.19 billion from mobile money transfer services and airtime. The taxes on airtime and financial transactions mirrored Safaricom's revenue performance on telephone services and M-Pesa for the financial year ended March 2024. M-Pesa revenue grew 19.5 percent to Sh140 billion while data revenue rose 25 percent to 67.4 percent. Voice revenue retreated by 0.6 percent to Sh80.5 billion while messaging revenue went up 8.3 percent to Sh12.3 billion. Data from the Economic Survey 2024 published by the statistics office shows that the government collected excise duty amounting to S5.19 billion from financial transactions in the financial year 2022/23, an increase of 10.5 percent from S0.89 billion collected in the previous period.  Excise duty, popularly known as six tax, had for long been slapped on luxurious and harmful products such as alcohol, cigarettes, gambling, juice, motor vehicles, soft drinks and cosmetics. However, the government expanded the list of excisable goods to include airtime, financial transactions, fuel, and internet data services.  In financial year 2022/23, collections from beer recovered from a dip of Sh27.35 billion to Sh32.09 billion. Excise from wines and spirits, another category of alcoholic beverages which includes Vodka, Whiskey and Gin, also dropped marginally to Sh18.9 billion as sales declined due to increased taxation which depressed imports and production.",NEUTRAL,2

Many dramas with ancient Chinese backgrounds are spreading false information. &lt;Â∞ë‰∏ª‰∏îÊÖ¢Ë°å, Soju Cha Man-haeng&gt;: The main character is dressed in typical hanfu, and only the maids are dressed in female hanbok. &lt;‰∏âÁîü‰∏â‰∏ñÂçÅÈáåÊ°ÉËä±, SƒÅn shƒìng sƒÅn sh√¨ sh√≠ l«ê t√°o huƒÅ&gt;"": Likewise, only female hanboks were worn by maids. On the other hand, it can be seen that the jeogori is in the opposite direction. : The two dramas above are fantasy fusion historical dramas, but The Sleuth of Ming Dynasty is a historical drama set in the Ming Dynasty. However, there is a character who wore Got in the late Joseon style, and Mang-geon is described as Wang-gin of the Ming Dynasty, not Joseon's. Originally, the Wang-gin of Ming China looks different from the Mang-geon made of horse's tail. Wang-gin was a net-like hat. In fact, if you look at the original illustration, you can see that the testament was seriously wrong from the original. : The king in the red royal robe comes out low. # Joseon's royal court dress came from Ming China, but the background of the drama was not suitable for historical records. * There is a scene where the king of Joseon is sitting on his knees in the appointement ceremony of the Qing Dynasty? The king of Joseon has never been to Qing China himself!!!! He has never even participated in the Qing empress application ceremony. This drama is a representative case of history distortion. * Even in the original novel, a woman from Joseon appears as a wicked woman who undermines the main character, but no woman has ever been sent from Joseon at that time in real history!!! also In the novel , there is a scene in which the main character of the drama is mocked by wearing a tablecloth and calling it hanbok. Now, On Weibo, China's social networking sites, there are also postings calling Korea a thief country. This means that Korea is stealing Chinese culture. ""Now, let's call Korea a thief country,"" ""This thief country used to belong to us,"" and ""We must let them know that Korea is taking away Chinese culture.""

But also I'm here for you if you need more education or guidance on that. So, given what you've told me so far, it sounds like you might have developed a clot in your leg somewhere, simply because you had a surgery and you were not moving around very much. Sometimes that causes the blood to kind of, not move around your body is as as much as it usually does, and kind of stays in one place and get turned into a clot and that clot can sometimes get dislodged and settle into your lungs, and that can make it difficult for you to breathe. So, we'll do some tests that that's what my understanding is. Given what you've told me so far, but we do have to confirm it using a test. Also, the fact that you smoke and your weight, and your BMI is high, increases your risk of developing a clot, so I would definitely strongly recommend that you continue to try to reduce both and try to quit smoking. And so we'll do an ultrasound of your leg and we'll do a scan of your chest and see what's going on and then decide if we need to give you any medications, like any blood thinning medications.",DOCTOR,1

35552,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.

35740,"For the owners of Shelter Distilling, making alcohol is fun‚Äì and drinking it, or just eating out with the family, should be too.After months of construction, the Caifornia-based distillery is finally Montrose-based, with the doors of its new 14,000 square foot flagship facility at 947 Mayfly Drive open as of this past Saturday. And despite hailing from the Golden State, founders Matt Hammer, Jason Senior and Karl Anderson are taking ""Colorado-based"" pretty seriously now, with whiskey made with Colorado bluecorn and provisions made with locally-sourced meats and veggies. ""The majority of stuff is being made from scratch,"" Hammer said. ""All the broths, everything is real food. And we're doing our best to use the most local ingredients."" Hammer's going for a gastropub vibe, with a high-quality menu characterized by a southwest flair. Dishes like elk carpaccio and peppered steak sandwiches will make appearances on the menu, which guests at Shelter's 200 seats can scan from QR codes at their tables. The spacious restaurant has plenty of seating to choose from, from traditional tables and barstools to cozy couches and outdoor firepits. All are outfitted with QR codes, and guests can order from wherever they sit and have the food brought out to them. Of course, the functioning distillery, which boasts around 10,000 feet of production space, wouldn't be complete without a well-stocked bar. Just like in the kitchen, the bar ingredients from syrups to vermouths and more, are made fresh and frequently in house. ""We're juicing every day,"" Hammer said. To start, the bar will have six beers on tap, and Hammer says this will bump up to an even dozen once production increases. The crew is still in the process of getting production up and running at the new facility, and for now the bar is stocked with California-made libations. But not for long. Shelter plans to make Montrose its new hub, with most of their products from bottled whiskeys to canned beverages manufactured here and sold around the country. For Hammer, Senior and Anderson, who formed the company out of their own home distilling hobby, the riverfront restaurant is a major achievement. The group started out by just brewing what they like, and Hammer said they still want to keep it fun and experiment with new flavors. ""It was just based out of passion,"" he said. ""We want to make cool things."" He said the bluecorn, which is sourced from Colorado, is one thing that make's shelter's bourbon unique and gives it a spicier flair. ""It's a small segment of the bourbon world,"" he said. ""Most people are using yellow corn."" In addition to whiskey, Shelter makes gins, agaves and assorted other spirits, in addition to beer and canned cocktails. These can range from classics like canned gin and tonics and whiskey and colas to more original products like the Rose Hip Thrust mule and Endless Summer gin beverage. ""We're never going to be like an old school whiskey company,"" Hammer said. ""We're just doing fun stuff that we love and we're doing it with quality ingredients and passion.""",NEUTRAL,2

Um and that is, it's pretty common um so it can be caused by um a lot of things, but basically your median nerve runs through your forearm into your wrist, and anything that squeezes or irritates that median nerve can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome, um and some things include um like repetitive movements at work, um obesity, um any nerve damaging conditions like diabetes, um inflammatory conditions, but mostly just like workplace factors can can do it, um especially if you're working with like vibrating tools or on an assembly line that requires like repetitive and prolonged flexing of the wrist. Um so uh diagnosis, we just do that through like symptoms, physical exam, um we don't really need to do any imaging at this at this point. And to treat it um basically work modification, so taking frequent breaks, uh not doing those repetitive movements um as often um and then you can do things at home, like apply cold packs. Um and then we also have some like non-surgical treatments where we can uh splint, we can put like a wrist splint um while you sleep to relieve those nighttime symptoms. Uh you can take some NSAIDs to relieve pain, um and if those don't work, we can try corticosteroids, um and if that doesn't work, then we can also discuss surgery sometime down the line.

Alcohol is probably best avoided on a low inflammatory diet but I decided to get gin and tonic as it is a nice low calorie option.  I have never really cared for gin and tonics before and found them bland.  After resetting my sweet addiction I was amazed at how nice the flavors are.

Wet the rim of a chilled Nick &amp; Nora glass with a lime wedge, and coat the rim of the glass in sugar.     3. Strain cocktail into glass.      4. Drop a maraschino cherry into the drink as a garnish.     **Umemiyabi**        2/3 oz Umeshu      1/2 oz Creme de Cassis     1/3 oz Calvados (Apple Brandy)      1/3 oz Orange Juice     1 tsp Ruby Port      1. Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe glass.    2. Garnish with an artificial white flower clipped to the rim.      **Horse's Neck (with a Kick)**     1 1/2 oz Bourbon, Rye Whiskey, or Brandy     2 dashes Angostura Bitters     4 oz Ginger Ale     1. Garnish a chilled highball glass with a ribbon of lemon peel in a spiral.    2. Build all ingredients in the glass with ice and gently churn to mix without losing too much carbonation.     (A Horse's Neck was originally a mocktail with just ginger ale and bitters.  It then became popular to add a ""kick"" of whiskey or brandy, and nowadays a Horse's Neck refers to the version of the drink with alcohol more often than not. For the mocktail version, use 3 dashes of bitters and 6 oz of ginger ale.)     The original cocktails from the contest use a lot of Suntory brand products.  Probably fine to substitute whatever equivalent you have:**Chimugukuru**     1 oz Haku Vodka     1/3 oz LeJay Pear (Pear Liqueur)     1/3 oz Hermes Blue Curacao     1 tsp Suntory Sudachi Watsunagi (Sudachi Syrup)     1 tsp Fresh Lime Juice     Salt?1. Shake first five ingredients with ice.     2. Wet half the rim of a chilled coupe glass with a lime wedge and coat with salt.     3. Strain the cocktail into the coupe glass.     4. Garnish with an artificial red flower clipped to the rim of the glass.     (I'm just guessing that the half-rim shown in the episode is salt.  Could just as well be sugar.)**Headwind (Mukaikaze)**     1 oz Suntory World Whiskey Ao      1/3 oz Kimia (Kumquat Liqueur)     1/3 oz Drambuie     1 tsp Suntory Ginger Watsunagi (Ginger Syrup)     1 tsp Fresh Lemon Juice     1.

38190,"‚Äã@@HAHAHO289It is important that after the 17th century, the leadership of Chinese culture was dominated by the Manchus of Qing. Chinese culture was brought back hundreds of years by Mongolia, and the Han Chinese culture was once again deleted by Qing. On the other hand, South Korea was able to escape China's hegemonic war through diplomatic tactics. There are many Chinese who want to believe that the cultural confidence of the ancient Han Chinese is inherited by the modern Chinese. Ironically, however, China tried to remove tradition and Confucian culture through the Cultural Revolution. Decades later, the Chinese began an online incitement to turn Korea into th1ffffcountry to edit history and recreate traditional culture. The Chinese, who claim that both Korean tradition and social culture are Chinese heritage just because ancient Koreans were influenced by Chinese culture, are making a logical leap. For example, during the Joseon Dynasty, hats and Mang-geon headbands were one of the traditions developed by ancient Koreans. However, countless Chinese people today are participating in the Hanfu fashion show wearing Korean hats and Mang-geon. Why don't they honestly use Ming hats and Wang-gin of their artifacts? Also, Ming's golden belt is identical to the golden cultural relics of the ancient Xianbei and northern Scythians. And the round neckline dress was also other ethnic culture such as Hobok(hu dress) influenced by the culture of other peoples in the north. The skirt shape, pants, aoqun design(Top clothe), Terlig, hats, and square necklines were all influenced by the Khitan, Jurchen(ancient Manchu people), Mongolian, and Goryeo cultures. But now the Chinese are changing the whole truth in the name of Hanfu. In fact, the Han have not been able to discern their traditions since the Mongol period. It doesn't make sense for the Chinese to talk about cultural confidence today. It is also not logical for the Chinese to claim ownership in culture. This is because the name ""China"" comes from Sanskrit, which means numerous branches. However, many Chinese argue that everything of unknown origin was influenced by the Yellow River civilization. This is only a political act that recognizes neighboring countries and people from other countries as part of Chinese culture and constantly justifies Chinese centralism. To say that the Chinese are cultural confidence is sophistry. They hide the truth, such as the cultural disconnection and footbinding of the Han people.‚Äã",NEUTRAL,2

Ned Lamont at Good News Restaurant and Bar), but he's partnered with a Connecticut distillery for a new role. Under new ownership, according to a news release, Mine Hill Distillery in Roxbury hired the actor to spread the word about its gin and bourbon in two commercials that launched online today. In the ads, Meloni touts Connecticut history, including its invention of the hamburger, and ingredients in making these two spirits distinct. He says that the spirits are only available in Connecticut, but the release states that ""the brand is poised for national growth"" under new owner Zachary Karabell. Karabell, an author with a background in finance, purchased the distillery with a group of investors last year, according to the release.Previously, Mine Hill was owned by Elliott Davis, who bought an 1860 cigar factory and 1872 train station in Roxbury, which he spent years converting into a distillery that opened in 2018.The release states that now, Mine Hill is producing vodka, rye whiskey and amaro, in addition to the gin and bourbon Meloni advertises. According to the release, all are made with grains grown in Connecticut at the Colonial-era Thrall farm.Meloni was nominated for an Emmy in 2006 for his role as Elliot Stabler. In addition to his acting in the ""Law &amp; Order"" universe, he starred in ""Oz"" and appeared in ""Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle,"" ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wet Hot American Summer.""

But in the mean time, and I guess even if the test is negative, um and you're still having symptoms, please do isolate for 14 days. Um and if your symptoms get worse, um like you know, you're having trouble breathing, uh your fever, your temperature is off the charts, um or you're having any sort of neurological symptom, please do um go to the ER and seek out help. Um if it's not Covid, it could be another viral illness that's going around at, during this time of year, um, and usually the treatment for that kind of stuff is supportive, so make sure you're staying well hydrated, you're eating nutritious foods, uh you're getting good sleep. Um and if not, and your symptoms, you know you're having a productive cough, um you're really short of breath, uh we can test you to see if you have some sort of bacterial pneumonia, and those are usually treated with antibiotics, so that's kind of the plan right now.

40188,"Diggin' in the Dirt Signature Gardens The signature of God is written in flowers Hi Everyone By early to mid-April it is safe to plant warm season annuals. Here are a few suggestions for annual color in your garden or in containers. Any suggestions where the name is in quotes (i.e. 'Profusion'), planting these specific cultivars will yield the best results. As mentioned in my Container Crazy! post, when planting containers, remember you want... a ""thriller"" (tall plants), a ""filler"" (plants to fill in the middle), and a ""spiller"" (plants that trail over the edge). By far the best container book I've ever had is called Easy Container Gardens by Pamela Crawford. She gives great plant combination ideas, and they all work for our Zone 7/8 climate! A suggestion from the April 2011 Southern Living magazine is to first find a foliage plant that you love. Then choose a second foliage plant with complementary hues and contrasting textures. And finally, add a bloom that pulls it all together. Some great annuals for summer SUN: Thrillers: Purple Fountaingrass Ti Plant or Cordyline (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Esperanza (Tecoma Stans) Variegated Tapioca (Manihot esculenta) Copperplant Perilla Magilla and Perilla Vanilla Canna Fillers: 'Profusion' or 'Zahara' zinnia or zinnia linearis (Star zinnia) Periwinkles/Vinca 'Cora' (plant periwinkles late May, early June) Pentas ‚Äì 'Graffiti' or 'Kaleidoscope' or 'Butterfly' varieties Angelonia 'Serena' series Crossandra 'Orange Marmalade' Begonia: 'Cocktail' or 'Whopper' series (bronze leaf) (a.m. sun) Dipladenia Melampodium Gomphrena Cosmos 'Intensia' Phlox 'Dakota Gold' Helenium Euphorbia 'Diamond Frost' (pairs great with pentas) Ornamental peppers Coleus (sun varieties) Croton 'Dragon's Breath' Celosia Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Spillers: Lantana 'Cora Cascade' Periwinkles/Vinca (plant late May) 'Wedding Train' Coleus (a.m. sun/p.m. shade) Mecardonia Moss Rose (portulaca) or Spanish Moss Rose or 'Samba' Portulaca Purselane Sweet Potato Vine (Margarita, Blackie, Ace of Spades, Bewitched, Emerald Lace &amp; Midnight Lace, Medusa) Blue Daze Verbena tapien or 'Homestead' Verbena Creeping Jenny Dichondra 'Silver Falls' Sedum 'Lemon Ball,' 'Reflexum,' 'Potosinum,' 'Sarmentosum', etc. Purple Heart Scaevola - Fan Flower Thyme Annuals for SHADE: Thrillers: Iresine Persian Shield Variegated Ginger Lemon Lollipop or Golden Shrimp Plant (Pachystachys lutea) Spike Mona Lavender Ti Plant/Cordyline Caladiums (do not plant until soil temps are about 70 degrees) Fillers: Dragonwing or Whopper Begonias Waxleaf Begonias (green leaf) Alternanthera (sun or shade) Coleus (sun or shade varieties) Hostas Oxalis 'Everillo' Carex/Sedge (filler/spiller) Spider Plant (filler/spiller) Spillers: 'Wedding Train' Coleus Summer Wave Torenia or 'Bouquet' series Sweet Potato Vine (see above for varieties) Creeping Jenny Purple Heart Hemigraphis Asparagus Fern (filler/spiller) Swedish Ivy English Ivy (Hedera helix 'Needlepoint,' Glacier,' etc.) Note: You will not see petunias, geraniums, marigolds on my list because they just can't take the summer heat! They are fine for planting an early spring container, if you'd like, but plan to replace with more heat tolerant plantings once the temps start to rise. I no longer recommend impatiens because they are susceptible to downy mildew. Don't be wooed by flowering snapdragons and alyssum; they are cool season annuals that should be planted in the fall. Watering: I know this is contrary to my usual watering recommendations for your garden, but I have found that watering my container plants in the evening helps the plants to perform much better through the summer. sample layout options Scroll down to see pictures and suggestions for container combination plantings.
